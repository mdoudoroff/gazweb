	<p class="notes">Adapted from a recipe by Todd Appel, Piranha Bros., Chicago, IL.</p>
	<p class="notes">“The Campari and Grapefruit Cordial both have intense flavors and aromas and are used just to the point where they complete the cocktail, and not overpower the gin. The Grapefruit Cordial is the craft side of this cocktail that brings the flavors of grapefruit out in an intense tart and sweet syrup, with the aromas of grapefruit from the peel that is infused into the syrup. This also has the effect on the texture of the cocktail by lessening the non-essential water content of the unshaken cocktail that will be replaced by the ice melt after shaking. This helps immensely with balance and texture. A little of the cordial goes a long way. There are wonderful botanicals in the gin and Campari. Bitterness in the Campari and Grapefruit Cordial. Sweetness in the Campari and Grapefruit Cordial. Acid in the Grapefruit Cordial and dryness in the gin. For a mature palate and for all seasons, but really shines as a refreshing summertime aperitif cocktail served up, or on the rocks, or poolside as a long drink topped with soda. Served up, the hard shake really brings the temperature down, and leaves shards of ice floating and the cocktail glass freezing on the outside...perfect in the summertime! Visually striking. Beautiful color becomes a natural opaque, reddish pink from the Campari and Grapefruit Cordial and a glass frozen with summer humidity. The name Solleone means ‘summer heat’ in Italian, I crafted this Summer 2010. Similar cocktail styles...Gimlet, Negroni.” Todd Appel.</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: Nice of Todd to share his grapefruit cordial recipe with us all, right? A darned good cordial it is, too. I also like the way that the Aperol and the cordial let the Beefeater 24 take center stage here. It’s a very well-balanced drink.</p>
