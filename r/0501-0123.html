	<p class="notes">Adapted from a recipe by Nick Caputo, The Priory Tavern, London</p>
	<p class="notes">“A modern take on the Clover Club using the contemporary Beefeater 24. Using a green oolong tea as the base for the fresh raspberry syrup and a different citrus, it highlights the qualities of the gin’s unique character and gives a modern fresh take on an old classic. Although I didn’t enter it into this year’s Beefeater Competition it was my idea to take a classic Clover Club (i am still searching for someone that dislikes the drink :) ) and twisting it to fit the gin—playing on the history of the gin, the cocktail and America’s role on cocktail history.</p>
	<p class="notes">“My idea started with the basic drink, replacing the citrus and with grapefruit to bring out that clean fresh note in 24, then using oolong to work with the raspberries which gives it that crisp fresh grassy spice and earthy profile which pushes the juniper and gin to the forefront whilst still being balanced and refreshing. The Lillet rosé was added to give it some complexity and depth on the finish; to tie the citrus, earthy juniper and tannin from tea, making the flavour linger.</p>
	<p class="notes">“In terms of the name I liked the idea of the cocktail boom in America pre prohibition when the Clover Club first said to have been created and the great rivalry America and Britain always had pre 1900’s. The idea that Gin was typically a British thing and the American’s were using it to create such beautiful libations - it felt natural especially since James’s Burrough’s Beefeater was one of the most iconing London Dry Gin’s available to twist it with 24. Using its botanicals to highlight its strengths and show the modernization in gin by altering this classic to fit.</p>
	<p class="notes">“The tea in particular being something that the British were known for after first getting tea from the orient originally as green tea but by the time it returned home it was dried and black. So when Beefeater’s Master Distiller incorporated this into Beefeater 24 by using Japanese Sensha tea and Chinese Green tea in its production, it was something to highlight the great journey of tea export Britain had by using it in the drink, almost reflecting the gin’s travel to America through its own export.</p>
	<p class="notes">“So this rivalry and history brought me to the name War of the Roses... it uses traditional ingredients in a modern way, illustrates two great nations rivalry and coming together to create tasty drinks and also nods to Britain’s heritage.”—Nick Caputo</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: Yeah, right, what Nick said. This is the second green-tea drink I’ve loved this year. Pretty astounding when you consider that I hate green tea…</p>
