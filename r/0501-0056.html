	<p class="notes">Adapted from a recipe by Natalie Jacob, Dutch Kills, Long Island City, NY.</p>
	<p class="notes">“The Jack Rose has always been one of my favorite classic cocktails, and Lairds one of my favorite spirit brands. It is so rich in history, and not only history of our great spirits industry, but rich in history of our country and my home state New Jersey. My other favorite classic cocktail containing Lairds was the Jack in the box aka Jersey City. This cocktail is featured in David Embury’s The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks under cocktails based on the applejack sour. Which is what really comes to mind when I think of a jack rose, sweet and sour and strong. I am also born and raised in Jersey City, and I thought it would be fun to [make a variation] on both cocktails together.</p>
	<p class="notes">“I wanted to smooth it out a little more and the sweetness of the pineapple juice takes care of that, and the lemon juice balances it out from making it too sweet, grenadine (because it wouldn’t be a jack rose without it), Lairds Applejack, and a dash of angostura bitters to add more depth to the drink. Quite simple, but I believe some of the best cocktails are. </p>
	<p class="notes">“I named it after the character in Ernest Hemingway’s novel, the Sun Also Rises, because Jake Barnes sits down at the bar of the Paris Crillon Hotel and orders a Jack Rose.”—Natalie Jacob</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: I wrote about this one in the San Francisco Chronicle, and I totally agree with Natalie when she says, “Quite simple, but I believe some of the best cocktails are.”</p>
