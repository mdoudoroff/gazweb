	<p class="notes">“The Gold Dagger Award was an award given annually by the Crime Writers’ Association for the best crime novel of the year. From 1995 to 2002, The Macallan has been the sponsor of it. The cocktail is actually quiet dark because of Averna, and for this is called the Dark Dagger.” Lorenzo Miglietta.</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: Ah, The Macallan. What a damned fine whisky is the Macallan. It seems a shame to add anything but a few drops of spring water to this fine scotch, but on the other hand it would be an even bigger shame to make this fabulous drink with anything less than The Macallan. It really holds its own here, and not many other scotches could do that.</p>
	<p class="notes">I’m not sure which fig liqueur Lorenzo uses in this drink, but it’s the fig liqueur that holds this baby together. I went for the Briottet Crème de Figue when I tested this recipe, and it worked very well indeed. Here’s a nice simple drink that proves that scotch is a great base for cocktails. Thanks, Lorenzo.</p>
