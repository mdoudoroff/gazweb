	<p class="notes">Martin Hudák, Dublin Café, Prešov, Slovakia</p>
	<p class="notes">“In our bar (Dublin Cafe) we have a lot of guests but only one was actually Irish—Brian Lillis. He sat every day in the same place and drank the same things like coffee, tea or fresh juice. It was like that for four years and then he had to move back to the Ireland because of the work. That was the perfect moment for creating something big so as a gift we gave him some mystical bridge between our two countries. Of course the best way was [to create a new] cocktail. Our team joined together and put out a combination of national plum liquor Slivovica with grandma’s plum jam, Irish honey herbal liqueur Irish Mist, and a few drops of fresh lemon juice. Now [we like to think that] Brian is sitting at home in Ireland and sipping his friends’ connection with honor and best memory to Slovak Dublin Cafe next home.”—Martin Hudák</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: This one’s worth running if only for the story behind it, but it really is a great quaff, according to one of my secret shoppers in London. I couldn’t get hold of aged slivovitz here in the USA, so a bartender friend in the UK tested this recipe, and she says she was blown away by how well it worked. Congrats, Martin! Hope that our paths cross soon.</p>
