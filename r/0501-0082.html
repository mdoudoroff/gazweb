	<p class="notes">Adapted from a recipe by Oron Lerner, Mapal Bar,Haifa, Israel.</p>
	<p class="notes">“I did this for TotC’s Truly Old Fashioned entry, which is sadly the only one open to any bartenders and not just US ones. I sent this recipe for an Old Fashioned contest and was looking for a way to create something modern, new and still true to the Old Fashioned.</p>
	<p class="notes">“I recently tried and enjoyed Guiseppe Gonzalez’s Trinidad Sour, using 1.5 oz of Angostura Aromatic Bitters, and the guests around here have recently found the Seelbach cocktail to be very pleasing so I decided to try and reverse the ratios in an Old Fashioned and create a recipe that uses bitters by the ounces. Yours was first on the list and sampling the bitters straight, I came up with the recipe. The cognac rounds the flavors, the sweetness balances the bitters and the smoky flavor adds a pop to the drink. Looking for a fitting garnish I found a jar of Bergamot peels infusing and gave it a try, which added perfumy scents and it just ended up splendid.</p>
	<p class="notes">“I currently run the Mapal bar. Mapal is an abbreviation of ‘waterfall,’ but could also be short for ‘Word of Mouth,’ which is exactly what it is, a very small (20 seat), quiet bar, focusing on providing a cocktail atmosphere at reasonable prices. We are a speakeasy styled bar, so no address and no publicity, but we occasionally do open cocktail nights in other bars and are usually a great success, by local standards of course.”—Oron Lerner.</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: I know young Oron from the G’Vine Gin Connoisseur Program, and I can vouch for the fact that he’s a great sport, and a fabulous bartender, too. This guy is one of the few bartenders who has been experimenting with using large amounts of bitters in their new creations, and he’s got a good handle on how to make this work. I think that it’s Oron’s Demerara & Smoked Tea Syrup that binds this one together and gives it a sturdy backbone, though. It’s a very well-constructed drink.</p>
