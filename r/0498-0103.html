	<p class="notes">“A drink I created this year for our annual Appleton Estate competition. My drink starts with the base of Appleton 12, using the base characteristics of vanilla, nutmeg, walnut, orange, I find this rum to have a delicious earthy characteristic reminiscent of fresh blackberries and that earthy woody characteristic they have underneath that sweet sour berry fruit flavour. The other thing I love about Appleton 12 is it has that ability that the best mixing spirits have, where you can just hang flavours off it and it will compliment those flavours and also be complimented by them, you have at the same time perfect beautiful marriage of flavours but they also retain their individual characteristics. So using blackberries and Appleton 12 with the plan of continuing with classic flavor combinations, we add some lemon for freshness and its quintessential sourness, then comes in the vanilla sugar. Whilst I tried to avoid using vanilla sugar as I cringe at the sight of vanilla when I see it in cocktail menus as it’s a much abused flavour and to me summons up warnings of noviceness, the spice of the vanilla ties in perfectly with the character of the rum and blackberry, and vanilla is a classic flavour much and the drink was just too much better with it so I swallowed my own prejudice and let my taste buds have a treat. Vanilla would have to be the easiest ingredient to use but one of the hardest to use well and I believe it is used incredibly well in this drink. Lastly we use a few dashes of Angostura to amplify the rum, accentuate the wooden earthiness of it all, add a lovely aroma and hint of clove, and tie up all the loose ends bringing it all together. If the rum is the Christmas tree, the lemon, vanilla and blackberry the decorations the Angostura is definitely the string on which they all hang. Cheers to you!” Guy Jacobson.</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: Guy didn’t really leave me anything to say about this drink, but I do love the fact that he thought the recipe through very thoroughly, indeed, and he selected his base spirit for all the right reasons.</p>
