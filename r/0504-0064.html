	<p class="notes">“It was a slow night at the bar and me and a guest were having a nice little conversation primarily about Scotch. I had let him try a taste of the Monkey Shoulder Blended Malt Scotch that we had just gotten in at the time. He loved it (cause it’s wonderful). At some point in the conversation he tells me that he thinks it’s so crazy that he loves the smell and aroma of an Islay Scotch but he can’t handle the taste, it’s too much for him. He said that he had tried so hard to like them because the smell intrigued him so much but the taste just isn’t for him. So it goes. When it came time for the next cocktail he asked me to surprise him. He likes Rob Roys and Blood and Sands but he wanted to try something new, so I wanted to come up with something that would be the best of both worlds for him. Some smoke without fire,”—Thomas Newcomb.</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: I loves me some Monkey Shoulder, so I does, and this baby makes real good use of it, too. And I just ADORE the way the way in which Thomas uses the Islay mist as an aromatic garnish here. Inspired, it is. Inspired, I tell you!</p>
