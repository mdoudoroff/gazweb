	<p class="notes">Adapted from a recipe by Erika Joyner, Salt of the Earth, Pittsburgh, PA.</p>
	<p class="notes">“The Krampus cocktail is a surprising bright red treat. At first you think the cocktail might be too sweet, then the Campari comes in and cuts it. Then a kick of heat and smooth chocolate finish. It’s like a party for your senses. You can also shake the cocktail with a piece of hot pepper instead of infusing into the vodka. The molasses simple is made by matching equal parts water and molasses.” Erika Joyner.</p>
	<p class="notes">“Krampus is the dark counterpart of Saint Nicholas, the traditional European gift-bringer who visits on his holy day of December 6th, a few weeks earlier than his offshoot Mr. Claus. Like his American descendant, the bishop-garbed St. Nicholas rewards good kids with gifts and treats; unlike the archetypal Santa, however, St. Nicholas never punishes naughty children, parceling out this task to a ghastly helper from below.</p>
	<p class="notes">“Known by many names across the continent, such as Knecht Ruprecht, Klaubauf, Pelzebock, Schmutzli and Krampus, this figure is unmistakably evil; he often appears as a traditional red devil with cloven hoof and goatish horns, although he can also be spotted as an old bearded wild-man or a huge hairy beast. He comes to punish the naughty children, and is often depicted carrying them in chains or in a basket to a fiery place below.” From www.krampus.com.</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: Here’s a spicy dram that jumps all over your mouth then glides down the throat as innocently as a baby. What was that? You ask yourself. Next thing you know you’re going back for more. It’s pretty astounding.</p>
