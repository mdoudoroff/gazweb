	<p class="notes">Adapted from a recipe by Rick Tose, The Classroom, Manchester, England.</p>
	<p class="notes">“I was doing a few guest shifts while home on holiday and was trying out a recipe to submit in a local Jameson’s cocktail comp the bar was about to hold. It’s a summer sipper, playing on the earthy, yet vanilla and sherry characteristics of the whiskey, by complementing them with heather and spice which match perfectly with stone fruit. The drink is then lifted with citrus and a dash of bitters rounds it off nicely, lifting noticeable hints of the Drambuie through. The customer said she could sit and drink these all evening by the water as the sun went down, hence the name Puesta del Sol (sunset).”—Rick Tose</p>
	<p class="notes">After telling Rick that his drink had been chosen for inclusion here, he wrote, “One thing I forgot to tell you about (totally not on purpose), was that the name of the drink was originally called “Gorgeous Gus” after the nickname given to one of the coopers (Willie McCann) at the Jameson’s Distillery by John Jameson. It was cheeky and reflected the drink and the style of drink, whilst giving a nod to the clientele of whom the soft introduction to whiskey would appeal! The name change was due to the fact that anyone who geeked-up for a Jameson’s Comp could have called their drink the Gorgeous Gus and potentially there could be a few of them! I think Puesta del Sol fits it nicely, but as it is your publication you are more than welcome to use the original-name story or give a nod to it in the descriptions!” Thanks, Rick. You’re one strange dude, but the Manchester thing explains much.</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: I’ve seen people in Manchester get the hell beaten out of them for coming out with flowery prose such as Rick’s description of this drink, but I must say that he just about nails it, and I love the way the apricot brandy plays pretty with the Drambuie in this one. Nicely done, Rick.</p>
