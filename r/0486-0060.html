	<p class="notes">Adapted from a recipe by Ian Storror, Future Inns, Bristol, England.</p>
	<p class="notes">“I wanted to come up with a long drink (as I don’t normally), after trying a lot of long rum-based (rum’s my favourite) drinks I was left with a little something missing. I’d been tending to drink my good rum with varying measures of falernum and lime as in the West Indies, loving the simplicity of flavour, but for a longer drink it needed something else. Experimented with various “Bucks” and decided to twist the original with a nice spiced sugar syrup with a little local pep (Somerset UK) and a sweet ‘extra’ to match the lime! It turned out to be the best long drink I’ve done and is so more-ish, it shouldn’t date. Using the 50 ml of rum (Long Shot) and it being based on a Buck (Buck-et!) there was a natural choice for the name. The Pioneers song (late 1960s) of the same name (later covered by The Specials). It refers to a real legendary racehorse in Jamaica called “Long Shot” who was a long-lived but not very successful horse. Despite this many on the island loved it, backed it, and lost on it! On its 203rd race it came a cropper just as it was coming up the rail to win, a horse called Combat fell and brought down Long Shot! (check out the lyrics). Doh! Dead meat. When I did this for a comp’, I used the in-house PA to play the track, starting to mix after the “Call to Post” trumpet blast. Mixing reggae style (soon come, steady as she goes), finishing and presenting at the end of the track to generous applause and whoops of great laughter. The drink went down well enough for Long Shot to win one for a change!”—Ian Storror</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: Phew! Ian can be pretty longwinded, huh? Great drink, though. I used Appleton VX rum and Laird’s Bottled-in-Bond applejack. It worked very well, indeed. It’s the spice syrup that makes this baby stand out.</p>
