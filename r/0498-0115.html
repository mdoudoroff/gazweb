Using a swizzle stick, swizzle for 45 seconds, making sure the glass is nice and frosty on the outside and that all the ingredients are well mixed. Top with more <a href="../i/1092.html">crushed ice</a>. Dash liberally the <a href="0498-0116.html">Improved Bitters</a> over the <a href="../i/1076.html">ice</a> until the top is entirely covered. Add the garnishes.</p>
	<p class="notes">Adapted from a recipe by Brian MacGregor, Jasper’s Corner Tap, San Francisco, CA.</p>
	<p class="notes">“This was a drink I originally came up while doing a guest bartender spot at the Needle in Thread, within Tavern Law, in Seattle. I recall serving it to the always generous Paul Clark. I later refined it for the Appleteon Re-Mixology contest, where it was chosen for the semi-finals here in SF. Sadly I did not win said contest, but I had fun nonetheless. This little ditty is refreshing and complex. With a bold rich flavor of all the ingredients coming through with a burst of flavor right out the gate, yet has a beautiful finish as the aromatic blend of the bitters come through in the end. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.” Brian MacGregor.</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: Brian does really good work when it comes to creating drinks, and the Subterranean Swizzle is a great example of his mastery of the craft. Hell, his improved bitters are a masterpiece all on their own.</p>
