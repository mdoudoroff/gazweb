	<p class="notes">Adapted from a recipe by Daniel-Grigore Mostenaru, Radisson Hotel, Bucharest, Romania.</p>
	<p class="notes">The following text originally appeared in The San Francisco Chronicle.</p>
	<p class="notes">It took Daniel-Grigore Mostenaru, a bartender from Bucharest, to really nail a drink called the My Way Manhattan, so I sort of think of him as being the Sid Vicious of classic cocktails. I do hope that he approves.</p>
	<p class="notes">It took me a little while to translate the recipe that Mostenaru sent to me, but that had nothing to do with English not being his native tongue. It was his units of measurement that made me ponder a little.</p>
	<p class="notes">He didn’t use fluid ounces, of course. We’re the last nation on the face of the earth to use that system, I think. Are you listening, Mister President? But he didn’t use the metric system, either. Instead, Mostenaru presented his ingredients in terms of time.</p>
	<p class="notes">He called for “60 minutes of Four Roses bourbon, 30 minutes of Dubonnet Rouge, 1 second of orange curaçao, 1 second of Branca Menta.” And he went on to instruct, “first mist your mixing glass with seconds, then add the minutes, the ice, and stir for about 23 to 24 seconds.” Daniel-Grigore Mostenaru has a way with words, I believe.</p>
	<p class="notes">I’ll let this Bucharest bartender have the last word on this drink, I think. He described it as a “beautiful variation of a never-die cocktail with subtle flavours of bitters, fruit, and spices. It’s an underground drink for people whom enjoy a nice measure of bourbon.” Well said, Daniel-Grigore Mostenaru. Well said.</p>
