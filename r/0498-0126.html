Add <a href="../i/1076.html">ice</a> and remaining ingredients. Shake vigorously and double-strain into a chilled cocktail glass rimmed with <a href="../i/348.html">black pepper</a>. Add the garnish.</p>
	<p class="notes">Adapted from a recipe by Robert Merjavy, The Best Western Premier Queen Hotel, Chester, UK.</p>
	<p class="notes">“Drink must be cold, slightly green and cloudy. This drink was invented by Robert Merjavy on December 2010 in Chester UK.” Robert Merjavy. </p>
	<p class="notes">Gaz sez: Watercress, watercress, watercress! I loves me some watercress. It’s not all that well known in the USA, but it is gettable, and it is grow-able, too. In the UK, where I was raised, it’s a very common item at the greengrocer’s store, so I’m very familiar with watercress. In terms of this drink, watercress is one of the freshest tasting “leafy things” I know, and when you throw some elderflower, some Tanqueray, and some vermouth at it, it does a four-way tango with them all. If you’ve never sampled watercress, I envy you your first taste of the Watercress & Elderflower Martini.</p>
	<p class="notes">And for the nerds out there, go to www.watercress.com where you’ll find wonderful little nuggets such as this: “Watercress is believed by many to be an aphrodisiac. In Crete, islanders swear by its powers and ancient recipes are handed down from one generation to the next. In the 1970s, an Arab prince was reputed to have had special consignments flown out from the UK, presumably to help him satisfy his harem! And in Hampshire England, its special powers are part of folklore.”</p>
