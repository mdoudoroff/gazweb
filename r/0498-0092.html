	<p class="notes">“A strong, old-fashioned flavored rum drink that one may sit and enjoy while planning out where in the armada to make your strike.” Mattias Hagglund.</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: Here’s a great recipe that utilizes Batavia Arrack, made available to we Stateside folk by Eric Seed, a man I’ve already paid tribute to earlier in this book. The following is taken straight from his web site, Alpenz.com:</p>
	<p class="notes">A Celebrated Spirit in Punch, Classic Cocktails & Dark Chocolate</p>
	<p class="notes">Before the age of cocktails we had punch, and no spirit was more celebrated and sought for punch than Batavia Arrack. The trade of Batavia Arrack dates as far back as the early 17th century, when Dutch colonialists of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) found this alluring complement to the spice trade that brought them East, and soon found its passage with these voyageurs to Amsterdam and onward to growing demand in London and old New York. More so than rums, gins or other spirits, the Batavia Arrack had then as now the extraordinary effect of elevating the aromatics of the spices and citrus notes. While historical circumstance eventaully curtailed the availability and affordability of Batavia Arrack, it remains a highly sought ingredient for boutique chocolatiers and pastry chefs. </p>
	<p class="notes">It’s importance with classic cocktails cannot be understated. New York bartender Jerry Thomas’s 1862 imprint, How to Mix Drinks, or the Bon Vivant’s Companion (still considered the foundation-text for the fine art of mixing drinks) dedicates the first section of the book to Punches, with 78 recipes, many of which call for Batavia Arrack. Cocktail books still to this day highlight recipes with Batavia Arrack (or the Swedish Punch made from it), no matter the challenge of finding the spirit.</p>
	<p class="notes">Batavia Arrack comes only from the Island of Java. It is distilled from sugarcane and fermented red rice, using Chinese pot stills with characteristic teak vats.</p>
	<p class="notes">And here’s how Eric described Batavia Arrack in an interview with Paul Clarke for SeriousEats.com: “The flavor is a bit coarser and more rustic than many spirits out there now, but the arrack has a distinctive aroma, somewhere between Haitian rum and single-malt scotch, that makes it an interesting ingredient to work with. Accented with spice, citrus and black tea and softened with sugar, the arrack also makes a memorable punch that tastes something like history.”</p>
	<p class="notes">The Privateer cocktail is a strange bird that takes a little getting used to, but the drink really grows on you once you start to understand it. I had the same problem with oude genever when I first tasted it, but I persevered. . . .</p>
