	<p class="notes">Pauric Kennedy, Palmer & Co., Sydney, Australia</p>
	<p class="notes">“The bodega actually has a bit of a history to it. The drink was inspired by a trip to Amsterdam where myself and my fiancé accidentally walked into what they call a ‘bodega,’ a place usually only for locals which sells more than your usual coffee. We decided to stay and sample the wares (as one does on holiday in Amsterdam), and proceeded to realize why this place was only for locals. For the remainder of the afternoon, we floated around the town in a haze.</p>
	<p class="notes">“I wanted to create a cocktail that was both strong (haze inspiring), yet tasty to commemorate this trip.</p>
	<p class="notes">“Originally, The Bodega was made with genever and smoked ice, but has morphed into what it is now for the sake of simplicity in a high volume bar.</p>
	<p class="notes">It remains on the menu at Palmer & Co and is a favourite amount bartenders and regular patrons as well. It has been known to be referred to as a game-changer,’”—Pauric Kennedy</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: This is a pretty astounding drink as much as it darts all over the place in the mouth. One second it’s smoky, the next it’s fruity, then it gets all gin-y and bitter (Campari) at the same time. After a couple of these I think that you could safely say that you, too, could find yourself floating around the town in a haze, just like Pauric and his fiancé. I’ll try just one more, please . . .</p>
