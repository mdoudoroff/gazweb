	<p class="notes">Adapted from a recipe by Humberto Marques, 1105 cocktail bar, Copenhagen.</p>
	<p class="notes">“The idea of putting this cocktail together came from a research on licorice and cucumber: Every guy has wished for a miracle musk; a magical cologne that can ensnare the woman of his dreams. No such secret formula exists, of course, but the right scents can put a woman in the mood. I create a cocktail based on this idea. In the late ‘90s, Alan Hirsch, MD, of the Smell and Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago, set out to discover which scents really push people’s buttons. He exposed subjects to several scents and measured their sexual arousal by monitoring the blood vessels in and around the erotic zones of the human body. The results? A licorice and cucumber concoction was the most effective in triggering a response in both women and men. It’s an odd combination, but Hirsch found that it boosted sexual appetite in women more than any other smell. The explanation? ‘Odors are intricately associated with sexual arousal,’ Hirsch says. Licorice and cucumber don’t seem sexy, but Hirsch theorizes that their smells may make women comfortable and lower their anxiety levels.” Humberto Marques.</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: Ah, yes, the old licorice and cucumber trick. It works every time, right? Seriously, though, I was amazed to see how well these flavors harmonize. This is like having a barbershop quartet in a glass!</p>
