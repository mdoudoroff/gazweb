	<p class="notes">Hal Wolin, The Cocktail Guru, Inc., New York Team, USA</p>
	<p class="notes">“So a great story makes for an even better cocktail correct? Back in November of 2013 my girlfriend and I were approaching one year of dating and had plans to celebrate at Gramercy Tavern for a swanky romantic dinner and then to go out for drinks at one of our favorite New York bars, Death and Company.</p>
	<p class="notes">“As I’m always one who loves planning a surprise and enjoy a good story, with the help of the staff at Death and Company I planned to propose to my lovely girlfriend Jessica after our 1 year anniversary dinner. I came up with a cocktail that had all her favorite ingredients in it, Hendricks Gin, Mezcal, Luxardo Maraschino, and Grapefruit, and named it after one of her favorite Magnetic Fields songs ‘Love is like a Bottle Gin’. And as her favorite and lucky number is the number five, the drink is garnished with 5 maraschino cherries. I spent about three weeks testing recipes and variations and having Jessica taste each one, the entire time her not knowing what I was plotting.</p>
	<p class="notes">“Once I had the recipe finalized I decided I was going to freeze a place-holder engagement ring in a block of ice to propose to Jessica. After mentioning this to Jillian Vose, Eryn Reece, Scott James Teague and Frankie Rodriguez at Death and Company they were more than game to help facilitate this plan. A week before our anniversary dinner I stopped by Death and Company with the place holder ring for Frankie and Jillian to freeze for the drink.</p>
	<p class="notes">“That Saturday night after we finished our anniversary dinner, we were at Death and Company and for our second cocktail Jessica was served ‘Love is Like a Bottle of Gin’ which happened to have a place-holder ring frozen in the ice block. Once she figured out what was going on, I asked her to marry me and gave her the real ring. After I proposed and Jessica said yes, Scott and Eryn made an announcement to the entire bar and the celebration began.</p>
	<p class="notes">“And that’s how ‘Love is Like a Bottle of Gin’ was created,”—Hal Wolin gaz sez: What can I say? Yet another drink that shouldn’t work, but it does. And the Hendrick’s snuggles up real nice with the Vida mexcal, too. And of course, Hal’s fabulous story figured into the drink making it to the finals. That and the fact that he turned me onto the Magnetic Fields’ song, ‘Love is like a Bottle Gin.’ Great lyrics! Great drink, too.</p>
