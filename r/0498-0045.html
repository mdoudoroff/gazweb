	<p class="notes">Adapted from a recipe by Lars Erik Lyndgaard Schmidt, Byens Lys, Christiana, Copenhagen.</p>
	<p class="notes">eMail to Lars, December 1, 2011: FYI: I was just interviewed by the NY Times about drinks with weird ingredients and I forwarded your recipe to them because of the sea buckthorn juice which is unusual in the USA. Just got myself a bottle—it’s weird!</p>
	<p class="notes">Reply from Lars, later that same day: All right... Such a surprise. That would be it if FREETOWN FOREVER would be printed in NY Times. It’s based on all local ingredients. Fresh and with a huge amount of antioxidant. We serve it weekly to our event Science & Cocktail. [We] invite professors from around world its growing event here in Copenhagen, Denmark. It’s all free for public.</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: The following is straight from Wikipedia, so it must be true, right? “Christiania, also known as Freetown Christiania (Danish: Fristaden Christiania) is a self-proclaimed autonomous neighbourhood of about 850 residents, covering 34 hectares (85 acres) in the borough of Christianshavn in the Danish capital Copenhagen. Civic authorities in Copenhagen regard Christiania as a large commune, but the area has a unique status in that it is regulated by a special law, the Christiania Law of 1989 which transfers parts of the supervision of the area from the municipality of Copenhagen to the state. It was closed by residents in April 2011, whilst discussions continued with the Danish government as to its future, but is now open again.”</p>
	<p class="notes">Scandinavian bartenders are beginning to make their presence known in the international arena, and this drink serves to show us that some of them have style all their own. I urge you to try this drink, and if you do, you’ll be encountering sea buckthorn juice. It’s one of the weirdest flavors I’ve even encountered. It’s sour, vinegary, sweet, and fruity. Like nothing I’ve ever encountered before.</p>
