	<p class="notes">Adapted from a recipe by Tim Etherington-Judge, Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Mumbai.</p>
	<p class="notes">“This drink is served in two parts, each a half-sized portion. The city with two names spawns a twist with two flavours: Bombay—old colonial bastion of the British Raj from a time when the sweet vermouth’d Martinez was the martini of choice and gin was de rigueur. Mumbai—the hustling, bustling home of Indian fashionistas, Bollywood megastars, and the corporate elite where today’s trend is tomorrow’s passé.”—Tim Etherington-Judge</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: (To be served simultaneously with the “You Say Mumbai”) This is a drink that was tested by a mystery shopper as opposed to yours truly, and this guy, who travels to India regularly and is not a friend of Tim’s, came back raving about the complexities of these side-by-siders, plus he loved having two mini drinks in front of him. I hope I get to Mumbai soon so I can try these cocktails. Failing that, though, perhaps I’ll go to Bombay…</p>
