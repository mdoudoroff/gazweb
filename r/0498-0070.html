	<p class="notes">Adapted from a recipe by Tyler Fry, Side Door, Omaha, NE.</p>
	<p class="notes">“As a tea specialist who got into mixology through tea, I wanted to approach this recipe as simply as possible. My goal was to recreate an authentic cup of Indian masala chai in a cocktail, by using the three staple ingredients: spiced tea, milk, and a sweetener. The only difference here, is that our tea is steeped in booze, rather than hot water. In that sense, I approached this drink from a tea perspective, rather than a mixological perspective. Once my ingredients were settled, I simply turned to a classic Brandy Milk Punch for ideas on execution; hence the name “Masala Chai Punch.” As with any Indian masala chai, everyone will have their own proprietary recipe. You can choose any blend of chai, switch the milk for half-and-half or cream, or play with different sweeteners (honey, agave, etc.) A tip of my hat to Ms. Audrey Saunders of the Pegu Club for inspiring the mixology world with tea-infused cocktails.” Tyler Fry. </p>
	<p class="notes">Later, when submitting a picture of his drink, Tyler wrote this: These last months have been hectic and I was unable to get around to making a new infusion of Chai-spiced rum for this one. When first I e-mailed you I was working in Omaha, Nebraska at the Side Door, bringing New York-/Chicago-style cocktail experiences to corn country. Recently, however, I have relocated to Chicago in order to learn from the big boys, and I am pleased to announce that I am now a barback at the Violet Hour. It’s a dream come true.  After finally getting settled in Chicago, I am back to my old experiments and recipes. It occurred to me I might like to adapt the Masala Chai cocktail to a more complex recipe for the Violet Hour. My thought was that a cocktail of only rum, demerara and milk would not be fitting of the Violet Hour menu. However, after numerous variations (adding an amaro didn’t seem to improve anything, turning it into a flip was unnecessary) I have confirmed my initial mindset that simplicity is best for this cocktail. I had set out to make a cup of Masala Chai in cocktail form, and any ingredients other than the traditional tea-milk-sugar combo were uncalled for. </p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: Tyler has a lot to say, huh? I always find it intriguing when bartenders send in their thought processes, giving us a glimpse into what goes on in their heads when they are creating a drink, and Tyler’s able to do this very effectively. I’ve used chai before in a drink I featured in last year’s Annual Manual, and I think it’s a great way to add complexity to a drink. Tyler nailed this one, and he did that by keeping it simple.</p>
