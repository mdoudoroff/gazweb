	<p class="notes">Adapted from a recipe by Patrick Halloran, The Belcourt Theatre, Nashville, TN.</p>
	<p class="notes">“Christened by a coworker’s girlfriend who, upon smelling the rinse, said the drink smelled like a shoe.</p>
	<p class="notes">“The Belcourt Theatre is one of the oldest independently owned movie theatres in the South, and it is the only such theatre in Nashville. We specialize in foreign, independent, arthouse and repertory cinema, 99% of which we still project in 35mm instead of digital. While perhaps not a bar in the strictest definition, we have a ‘full’ bar which I’ve spent the last two years trying to improve. It is a slow and uphill battle, but I’m trying. Drinks like this, while simple, are starting to get customers in the habit of asking for something beyond a Jack and Coke.</p>
	<p class="notes">“Since the ingredients are so simple, I searched up and down to make sure I didn’t accidentally invent someone else’s drink before I submitted this. The only one that came close was from the Washington Square Tavern which uses Overholt, Fernet, and demerara. Coincidentally the drink is called the Feet First! Apparently those three ingredients invoke feet to bartenders?”—Patrick Halloran.</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: Hmm… Feet, huh? I always thought that Laphroaig—which I happen to adore—smelled more like a 3rd-world clinic filled with cigar smoke. Each to his own, I guess. I confess to using Bulleitt rye when I tested this drink, and there’s quite a difference between Bulleitt and Overholt, but what the hell. This is my style of drink. I love it. Simple as that.</p>
