	<p class="notes">Adapted from a recipe by Carol Donovan, Intoxicatingly Fun Cocktails, Chicago, IL.</p>
	<p class="notes">“I tried this with different flowers, and liked it with lavender, but the rose allowed for a beautiful glittery garnish! (I edge rose petals with edible glitter and float them on top). With the different flowers I had to tweak the ratios. The apple is really the only weight in the cocktail at all, so it needs to be muddled fairly well to extract fibers and juice both. For batching, I did use rose water rather than trying to get enough of the rose from petals.</p>
	<p class="notes">“This drink was a finalist in the Paris of the Plains cocktail competition 2012, and in the spirit of the fun I stirred it with a French tickler for the judging. :) It was universally well received by attendees and I am proud of how it turned out.”—Carol Donovan.</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: If you don’t know Carol, then make it your business to meet her. She’s delightful, crazy as a March Hare, and she has a smile that’s unmatched in the industry. This drink is just about as complex as they come, and the layers of flavors contained within burst to life on the tongue, singing glorious arias all the way down the throat. Nice one, Carol.</p>
