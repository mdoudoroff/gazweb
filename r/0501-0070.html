	<p class="notes">Adapted from a recipe by Frederic Yarm, Cocktail Virgin Blog, Somerville, MA.</p>
	<p class="notes">“St. Germaine [cocktail] appears in the 1937 Café Royal Cocktail Book, it pre-dates the elderflower liqueur of the same name by over 70 years, and it features a healthy slug of green Chartreuse that helped it get its name. The name is a reference to the Comte de St. Germaine who claimed to have created the Elixir of Life; Chartreuse was referred to as an elixir of life as well, although the two elixirs were unrelated until the creation of this recipe. In my variation, I swapped the original’s green Chartreuse, grapefruit, lemon, and mint garnish for yellow Chartreuse, orange, lime, and orange bitters garnish but kept the egg white-sour base the same. For a name, I went with Milord Gower, who was a Parisian comedian that made making fun of St. Germaine’s grand claims and far-fetched stories a large part of his act. The resultant cocktail is rather ambrosial and easy to drink.”—Frederic Yarm.</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: What a weird damned drink! But what a fabulous story, huh? “Get into the bar business and your education will be complete,” said my Dad. You were right again, Bernard. And this drink, weird as it might be, is worth a spin or two around the block. Try it and tell me I’m wrong.</p>
