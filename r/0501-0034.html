	<p class="notes">Adapted from a recipe by Rob McHardy, Silencio, Paris, France.</p>
	<p class="notes">“I just had a chat with my wonderful olive supplier here in Paris. They are Sicilians with a very intimate relationship with their suppliers back home and their shop la tete dans les olives in the 11th arrondissement is well worth a visit. They made the juice by taking quite a large quantity of capers and putting them in a bucket with holes in the bottom (to capture the juice), covering them with salt and letting osmosis draw the juice from the capers over time. Either that or get a load of capers in salt and press like mad/dance/sit /jump on them to extract the juice. They are not aware of anyone else doing this or at least bottling it (it does smell pretty rank).</p>
	<p class="notes">I use Cocktail Kingdom barspoons, which are roughly 3.4 to 4 ml to measure. The caper juice is strong enough to destroy the drink if even slightly more is added. But totally makes it when I get it right. Enjoy!”—Rob McHardy.</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: Rob is right about being careful with the caper juice in this one, and he also made a good decision when he decided to call for Tequila Ocho Plata—a fabulous bottling that comes on real strong in any sort of Margarita, Rosita, or Paloma. I had a great night in Paris with Rob when Monkey Shoulder scotch flew me out there to conduct a Mindful Bartender workshop. Rob is the real deal.</p>
