	<p class="notes">Adapted from a recipe by Marek Vojčarčik, U.N.C.L.E., Bangkok, Thailand</p>
	<p class="notes">“I think that many people will enjoy my Jack Jazz Rabbit, especially in summer time. [The] recipe is twist on my grandmother’s salad which she used to serve me during my childhood at late afternoons :-) It brings me always nice memories. The name comes from an old PC game where the hero is really crazy Rabbit who always messes around and collects carrots. [The flavor] is very fruity, natural and it’s a combination of healthy ingredients that will maybe very interesting for many people :-). The cocktail was first prepared for Bar Amazement Competition by Stan Vadrna and was served for more than half a year in Bratislava,”—Marek Vojcarcik</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: If you know my taste in cocktails you’ll no doubt be aware that this is not they style of drink I usually favor, but this recipe pretty much intrigued me so I had to give it a chance. Guess what? It’s fabulous. And it’s so unlike the vast majority of recipes that usually cross my desk, so I just had to choose it as one of this year’s winners. There’s chance I’ll be in Bangkok next year, and if that comes true, I’ll go pay Marek a visit for sure.</p>
