	<p class="notes">Adapted from a recipe by Brian MacGregor, Wingtip, San Fransico, CA, USA</p>
	<p class="notes">“This a great holiday/winter drink that is easy to execute but extremely complex in taste and depth. It has been one of our best sellers at Wingtip throughout the winter months. I used [two different] whiskies because each adds a different element to the drink. The dry grassiness of the rye played well with the sweetness of the bourbon. I have made this drink with multiple types of rye and bourbon, and it always seems to work.</p>
	<p class="notes">“As far as everything else goes... Life is wonderful, I love my job, working in a private club is way cooler than I thought, of course it helps when you have great members, and complete control over the entire bar program from the beginning. We just surpassed the 300 mark for number of whisky expression and there is no limit in sight. I am striving to make Wingtip one of the best environments to enjoy a dram, and having a large selection of well curated expressions helps. Our cocktail list is ever changing as well, which keeps both me, my bartenders, and our members engaged.”—Brian MacGregor</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: Brian knows well that if he offers up a drink that calls for a full three ounces of whiskey, he’s bound to get my attention, but I doubt that he knew how much I love the gingerbread notes in Snap liqueur, the ingredient that sends this drink rocketing through the roof as far as I’m concerned. Nicely done, sir. Very nicely done indeed.</p>
