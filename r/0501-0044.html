	<p class="notes">Adapted from a recipe by Giuseppe Santamaria, Ohla Hotel - Boutique Bar, Barcelona, Spain</p>
	<p class="notes">Giuseppe Santamaria, Best World Class Bartender Spain 2012, created this drink on occasion of the World Class Final, celebrated in Rio de Janeiro. With “The Gentlemen’s Secret” cocktail he won the Hollywood, Bollywood, Hong Kong Challenge, that had to be inspired by stars of the silver screen; a living legend or a screen god or goddess from the past.</p>
	<p class="notes">He wanted to pay a tribute to the Rat Pack, a group of artists and friends who became a legend in the 60s, for the performances and for living life to full. At the same time, he wanted to play with the romantic idea of bringing them back to the Prohibition Era, where speakeasys spread around. Giuseppe created a delicious twist of the classic cocktail Rob Roy, using a unique blended scotch whisky, Johnny Walker Blue, mixed with some sherry wine PX that gives it a soft and mellow flavour of raisins, and adding a fruity cake flavour of Pear liqueur. The final touch of Lavender bitter releases the chocolate notes of the whisky and add a fresh and relaxing scent note. Perfect as after-dinner.</p>
	<p class="notes">He managed to surprise some of the most renowned international judges, when he whispered the magic words: “This book contains the secret recipe of the Rat Pack, the “Gentlemen’s Secret”. They took the book in their hands and… What a surprise!, when they opened it, they found a hip flask hidden in it. Inside it was the cocktail.</p>
	<p class="notes">Giuseppe Santamaria still keeps surprising his guests at Ohla Boutique Bar, every time he serves this delicious drink.</p>
	<p class="notes">Note: As an alternative, Johnny Walker Gold can also be used.</p>
	<p class="notes">gaz sez: I’m a sucker for this drink. The flask presentation was fabulous to witness, of course, but like the Rat Pack, it was the drink itself that stole all the limelight. Grear flavors, and great balance.</p>
