	<h1>curaçao</h1>
	<p>Also known as orange curaçao</p>
	<p>Curaçao is a generic category for orange liqueur, distilled and/or infused ("home made"). Origins are Dutch, but became ubiquitous in the 19th Century. </p>
	<p>Contemporary commercial bottlings are typically simple, inexpensive orange liqueurs available in various colors but with similar flavor to one another, in neutral (or mostly-neutral) spirit base. Any specified color, such as “Blue Curaçao“, always denotes the addition of food coloring for visual effect. Without food coloring, distilled curaçao is naturally colorless; infused curaçao usually has some orange/yellow tinting from the citrus peels used during infusion. </p>
	<p>In terms of the original style of curaçao, the de facto benchmark in the US market is Pierre Ferrand Dry Curaçao.</p>
	<p>Curaçao evolved two branches beginning in the late 19th Century: one from brandy producers, who employed their aging stocks and attention to detail to produce high end curaçao exemplified by Grand Marnier (herein cumbersomely refered to as “orange-flavored liqueur with an aged brandy base”). The other branch was triple sec, a term for column-distilled curaçao that began when distilleries such as Cointreau set out to produce a highly refined liqueur built on neutral spirits. The “white curaçao” references found in recipes circa 1900-1940 can usually be presumed to mean triple sec.</p>
	<p>To make a simple, indeed crude, curaçao at home, infuse fresh and/or dried orange peels in pure grain alcohol for a period of days or weeks then dilute and sweeten to suit taste and purpose. (Recipes abound.)</p>
