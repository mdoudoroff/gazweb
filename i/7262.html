	<h1>cold brew coffee</h1>
	<p>Also known as cold press coffee</p>
	<p>Cold brew coffee refers to a homemade (or, uncommonly, commercially bottled) coffee infusion performed over many hours with chilled or room-temperature water, as opposed to hot water. The extraction from the cold brew process is generally less acidic and can vary in other ways. Please consult the Internet for details.</p>  </div>
