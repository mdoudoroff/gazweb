	<h1>Glenmorangie 10 Years</h1>
	<p>Also known as Glenmorange Original Single Malt Scotch</p>
	<p>Proprietary distillation of single malt Scotch whisky from the northeast Scottish highlands. Usually bottled in a 10 year cask age vintage, though special bottlings (of which there are several, always) are often aged substantially longer. Glenmorangie pioneered the practice of aging Scotches in barrels previously used for aromatized wines like Port and sherry.</p>
	<p>Legally delimited scotch producing region that approximately corresponds to the Grampian Mountains range and the North West Highlands. Also includes the subregions of Speyside as well as the Islands (except Islay). Scotch from the Highlands region is just that, and connotes no particular style or qualities.</p>
