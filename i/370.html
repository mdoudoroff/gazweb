	<h1>sugar</h1>
	<p>Also known as granulated sugar, superfine sugar, rock sugar, bar sugar, rock candy, castor sugar, loaf sugar</p>
	<p>Sugar refers to the refined crystalline product of sugar cane which is the sweetening of choice in the majority of mixed drinks. Sugar has come in many forms and have been applied to drinks accordingly: bar sugar is a far more finely-ground white processed sugar, more like a powder than table sugar. Sugar cubes are simply highly-compressed cubes of table sugar. Loaf sugar is the less-dense historic precursor to bulk sugar, coming in large & small cones weighing from 25 to 60 lbs., chunks being broken or shaved off as needed. Sugar lumps or chunks are merely irregularly-shaped nuggets of sugar, about the size and density of sugar cubes. Sugar is used as a garnish (as on a sugared glass rim) as well as a sweetener.</p>
	<p>Relatively large sugar crystals are often referred to as rock candy or rock sugar and may be naturally or artificially dyed different colors.</p>  </div>
