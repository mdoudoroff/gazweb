	<h1>coconut milk</h1>
	<p>Coconut milk is the liquid made by twice steeping and twice straining the combination of coconut water, found inside the coconut fruit, grated coconut meat (the white, mealy interior of this hard-husked fruit of the coconut palm) in hot water or scalded milk. Less common than coconut cream, and always as a flavoring in tropical drinks, it is featured in several obscure drinks (such as the Caribbean Caper) nonetheless. Coconut is also used as a drink additive for its flavoring in extract, syrup and liqueur forms. Used as a garnish, and its shell, halved, is used as a drink vessel.</p>
