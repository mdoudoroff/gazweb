	<h1>milk</h1>
	<p>Use of milk in drinks is in preference to heavier dairy products such as cream or half & half. As such, it occasionally appears in drinks which are not necessarily dessert drinks, though it is still common in them. For best effect, use whole milk—a high quality organic milk if possible—unless specified otherwise.</p>
	<p>Milk historically was also used for as a clarifying agent (an additive that clears cloudy liquid by bonding to particulate matter in the solution/suspension and causing said matter to fall to the bottom from the extra weight) of punches, spirits, liqueurs, and other alcohol preparations.</p>  </div>
