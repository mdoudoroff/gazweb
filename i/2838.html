	<h1>spirits</h1>
	<p>“Spirits” is ambiguous for a liquid with distilled ethanol as one of its components. Typically, the term applies to the direct product of a still as well as to liquids to which the product of a still has been added (e.g., fortified wine, most liqueurs). Alcoholic liquids that would not qualify as “spirits” would be those produced solely through fermentation, such as beer, wine and cider. Legal definitions of spirits—when there is one—often amount to a threshold of alcohol-by-volume (ABV), with spirits comprising any beverage with an ABV above some level.</p>  </div>
