	<h1>Martini & Rossi Bianco</h1>
	<p>Proprietary bianco-style vermouth.</p>
	<p>White vermouth is generic for the white/bianco/blanc (medium-sweet) style of vermouth invented by Dolin in Chamb√©ry. This style is often the most botanically intense. Variations on this style are now produced by many different vermouth makers. This style was not successful in the American market and there are few historical references in cocktail recipes, but interest is justifiably growing in recent years.</p>
