	<h1>Fernet Branca</h1>
	<p>Also known as Fernet</p>
	<p>Proprietary Italian bitter-sweet spirit-based beverage/digestive bitters. Pronounced fer-NETT BRAHN-ka.</p>
	<p>Fernet, pronounced FEHR-net, is generic for a venerable subclass of exceptionally strong-flavored amari (aperitif/digestif liqueur bitters) that most definitively features saffron amongst its copious botanicals. Fernet Branca is the definitive producer, joined by many imitations and variations. Earlier formulations probably included ingredients that have since become government-regulated.</p>
