	<h1>Auchentoshan Three Wood</h1>
	<p>Auchentoshan Three Wood is a proprietary example of lowlands single malt scotch.</p>
	<p>Legally delimited scotch producing region in southern Scotland that corresponds roughly to the Southern Uplands. Although the number of Lowlands distilleries is small, the largest volume of whisky is produced here, mostly for blending. Lowlands scotch is commonly associated with lighter-bodied single malts, although this a tricky assumption. Ultimately, scotch from the Lowlands region is just that, and really connotes no particular style or qualities.</p>
