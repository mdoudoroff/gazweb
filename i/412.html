	<h1>light rum</h1>
	<p>Also known as silver rum</p>
	<p>“Light rum” is a highly ambiguous term. Technically, it is generic for Cuban-style filtered, light-bodied and light-flavored molasses-based spirit more or less popularized by Bacardi in the early 20th Century. The rum can be colorless (filtered) or brownish and still be “light rum”: the distinction implies continuous still distillation for a highly pure, clean resulting spirit, not the color of the spirit in the bottle. However, “light rum” is often used incorrectly to imply a colorless, filtered, young rum, simply because such rums are so ubiquitous in the marketplace. </p>
	<p>In practice, a light brown (unfiltered) rum from Cuba, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands will deliver the light body as well as a pleasing rum flavor. Many rums from other places will also work well, but the styles of those three are the model.</p>  </div>
