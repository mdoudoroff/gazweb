	<h1>honey</h1>
	<p>Honey is a sweetener—made by bees from flower nectar—used in both cold and hot cocktails for sweetening, flavoring, consistency, and in preparation form, as a mixer. Popular sweetener for tropical drinks. The character of specific varieties of honey differ markedly depending on production methods and type of flower nectar. In cold drink applications, it is often prudent to dilute and dissolve honey with some water over heat to yield a honey syrup, because chilled undiluted honey tends to coagulate and resist incorporation into other liquids.</p>
