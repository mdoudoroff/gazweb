	<h1>Bols Genever</h1>
	<p>Proprietary genever gin sold in a smoked glass bottle in the shape of a traditional ceramic genever bottle. In the United States, Germany and the UK, a genever product introduced in 2007, ostensibly from an early 19th Century formulation that doesn't quite neatly fit into any of the contemporary classifications of genever. Technically a corenwijn, but higher proof than most corenwijns available in the Netherlands and exceptionally well-suited to mixology.</p>
	<p>Genever is generic for malty Dutch/Belgian/German grain spirits that played a prominent role in the 19th Century evolution of the cocktail as well as serving as the direct antecedent of English gins that are today much better known. Originally (prior to the invention and adoption of the continuous still in the mid 1800s), genever was a pot still distillate of cereal grains (rye, corn, barley and/or wheat). These early genever styles were a bit like an unaged whiskey. With the introduction of continuous distillation, various styles of genever gradually emerged that employ different levels of blending with neutral spirits and botanicals. Today, pure malt wine genever is extremely rare, but currently an assortment of styles is available regionally.</p>
