	<h1>Lillet Rouge</h1>
	<p>Also known as red Lillet</p>
	<p>Proprietary French sweet (rouge) variation of Kina Lillet introduced in the mid-20th Century. Uncommon in cocktails. Today confusingly marketed with identical labeling to Lillet Blanc, the straw-colored 1980s reformulation of Kina Lillet.</p>
	<p>Quinquina is generic for sweetened fortified aperitif wines containing quinine (thus “quinquina”) and spices. The major brands are: Bonal, Byrrh, Dubonnet, Lillet, and St. Raphael. The quinine is the bitter constituent which promotes production of digestive enzymes and, therefore, appetite. Most quinquinas are produced from mistelle (fortified grape juice) rather than actual fermented wine.</p>
