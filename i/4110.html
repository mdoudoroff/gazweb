	<h1>North Shore Distiller’s Gin No. 6</h1>
	<p>Also known as North Shore Distillery #6 Gin</p>
	<p>Proprietary artisanal dry gin in the approximate London Dry style.</p>
	<p>Gin is a generic category for neutral grain spirit infused with juniper berries and other botanical flavorings during or after the distillation process. Principal varieties of gin include genever, Old Tom, and London Dry Gin. Genever is distinguished by its malt wine flavoring, and London Dry gin is distinguished by being resolutely unsweetened—“dry gin”. Generally, when the term “gin” stands alone, London Dry Gin is what is meant. Novel gin styles exist, most of which draw from the same pool of botanical flavorings but emphasize or deemphasize flavors or seek a particularly strong (or particularly mild) overall character.</p>
