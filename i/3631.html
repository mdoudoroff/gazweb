	<h1>The Kraken Black Spiced Rum</h1>
	<p>Clove-forward proprietary spiced rum with copious caramel coloring, based on Trinidad rum and bottled in the United States.</p>
	<p>Spiced rum is a generic category for rum with additive flavors, originally (and still) considered a folk liquor in Jamaica, it has become popular as commercially bottled by companies like Captain Morgan and Bacardi. The prevalent spice in spiced rum is vanilla with other spices in slight evidence, though in folk preparations cinnamon and allspice berry flavors are also common.</p>
	<p>It is possible to compound your own homemade spiced rum: at its simplest, flavor an inexpensive rum (e.g., Jamaican) with a touch of vanilla; more sophisticated spiced rums can be produced by blending with tinctures to taste, or through direct infusion with spices and fruits</p>
