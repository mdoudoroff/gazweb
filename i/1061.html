	<h1>lemon shells</h1>
	<p>Also known as lemon rind, lemon hull</p>
	<p>A lemon shell is, literally, half a fresh lemon, minus the juice. Depending on the context, a “lemon shell” can refer to a cut lemon half that has had its fruit and seeds scooped out to form a bowl, or it can refer to the spent hull—often somewhat squashed—after it has been juiced.</p>
	<p>In some cases, notably the Crusta drink style of the 19th Century, a lemon shell refers to trimming a very large portion of a lemon’s peel in order to line the interior of a stemmed glass. This process is utterly dependent on the glassware used and the size of the lemons available; technique and improvisation are required.</p>  </div>
