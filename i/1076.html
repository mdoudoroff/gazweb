	<h1>ice</h1>
	<p>Ice is a generic category for frozen water as employed in mixed drinks and in serving vessels. The type of ice required depends on the intended technique and serving presentation. For example, stirred drinks often employ a combination of cube and cracked ice. Shaken drinks might employ a single large lump of ice, or a large quantity of cracked ice, or a scoop of large ice cubes, or even a scoop of crushed ice, all depending on the drink and what is available. There is considerable latitude for creativity and no hard and fast rules, although there are many opinions to be had.</p>
	<p>Actually, there are two incontrovertible rules about the quality of the ice in terms of purity and temperature. (1) Ice should be made using good, filtered water so impurities do not throw off whatever drink it is added to. (2) The best ice is as cold as you can make it. Ice can never be too cold. Well-chilled ice cubes can be lightly handled for several seconds without your hand getting wet.</p>  </div>
