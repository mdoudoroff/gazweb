	<h1>citrus honey</h1>
	<p>Citrus honey is a commercial (or homemade) preparation of honey with added/infused essence of one or more citrus fruit.</p>
	<p>Honey is a sweetener—made by bees from flower nectar—used in both cold and hot cocktails for sweetening, flavoring, consistency, and in preparation form, as a mixer. </p>
	<p>In cold drink applications, it is often prudent to dilute and dissolve honey with some water over heat to yield a honey syrup, because chilled undiluted honey tends to coagulate and resist incorporation into other liquids.</p>  </div>
