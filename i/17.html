	<h1>Amer Picon</h1>
	<p>Also known as Picon Amer, Amer Picon Black Label, Picon, Picon Amer Black Label</p>
	<p>Proprietary French bitter-sweet spirit-based aperitif beverage bitters with a defining-but-not-dominating orange character. Notable in the Basque drink, Picon Punch, which is considered one of the finest examples of a highball beverage. Unfortunately, from the 1970s to present, the House of Picon has lowered the proof of their product repeatedly, creating a situation where traditional recipes calling for it (such as the Picon Punch which was created with the original 78 proof product in mind) did not taste the same. </p>
	<p>Picon's current iteration has an alcohol content of less than half of the original product. Also, the product has trifurcated into three distinct products: Picon Amer, Picon Bière and Picon Club. The latter two are even lower ABV formulations intended for mixing with wheat beer and wine, respectively.</p>
	<p>Amer is the generic term for intensely-flavored aperitif/digestif bitters of French origin. Similar to the Italian “Amaro”. Amer tend to be lower proof than their Italian counterparts, and tend to be more focused on the aperitif role than the digestif role. Domestic imitations in some markets.</p>
