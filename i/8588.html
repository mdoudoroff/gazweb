	<h1>La Fée NV Absinthe Verte</h1>
	<p>Proprietary absinthe-like product formulated with an eye for mixed drinks. [Tentatively filed under pastis.—Ed.]</p>
	<p>Pastis is generic for lightly-sweetened anis-flavored absinthe substitutes, traditionally French and with a method of production like that of Ricard, the brand that coined the term. Currently a general term for sweet/bitter spirits envisioned as substitutes for absinthe, (minus the wormwood) but with similar character. Prominent brand examples include Absente, Herbsaint, Pastis 51, Pernod, and Ricard. Not to be confused with other, sweeter anis-flavored liqueurs like anisette.</p>
	<p>Note that, with careful discretion, it can be possible to substitute a true absinthe for pastis in some mixed drinks, particularly when only a small quantity is employed as an accent. In larger doses, the significantly higher proof of absinthe can be problematic.</p>
