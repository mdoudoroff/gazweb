	<h1>Monin Orgeat</h1>
	<p>Monin Orgeat is a proprietary example of orgeat.</p>
	<p>Pronounced orzh-AH or orzh-AHT, orgeat is a syrup of almonds, orange flower water and sometimes barley water often used in tropical and other cocktails. Now always nonalcoholic, it was once made with a small quantity of brandy. Clear to milky golden in color. Many brands are produced.</p>
	<p>Note that, with discretion, it can be possible to substitute some commercial almond syrups for orgeat in some mixed drinks.</p>
