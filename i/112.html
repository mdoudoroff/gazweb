	<h1>limes</h1>
	<p>A lime is the fresh ripe citrus fruit of any one of a number of plants, but in drinks, the “Persian lime” variety ubiquitous to American and European markets is implied unless otherwise specified. Typically a wheel or wedge-shaped slice of lime, or a strip of lime peel (twist) used as a garnish. 1/2 of a lime with the fruit removed is known as a lime shell, and is a notable garnish in drinks such as the Moscow Mule. Lime is also the basis for juice, syrup, liqueur, and spirit used in drinks.</p>  </div>
