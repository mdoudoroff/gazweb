	<h1>Disaronno Originale</h1>
	<p>Also known as Di Saronno, Disaronno, Amaretto Di Saronno</p>
	<p>Proprietary amaretto made from a base of neutral spirits and flavored with almonds and/or peach pits. Produced in Saronno, Lombardy, in northern Italy. Generally condsidered definitive of the amaretto category, at least by Americans.</p>
	<p>Amaretto is a generic category for Italian bitter almond flavored liqueur, now produced internationally. Notable brand example: Amaretto Di Saronno (which has now largely dropped the “amaretto” from its name, much as Cointreau dropped the term “triple sec” from its label 90 years ago—and for the same reason: too many competitors making amarettos and devaluing the liqueur Di Saronno made famous.)</p>
