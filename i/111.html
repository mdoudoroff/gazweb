	<h1>lemons</h1>
	<p>A lemon is the fresh, ripe fruit of the lemon tree, but in mixed drinks implies the now ubiquitous yellow Eureka cultivar common in the markets of the United States and Europe. Typically, a wheel or wedge-shaped slice of lemon, or a strip of peel (twist) used as a garnish. 1/2 of a lemon with the fruit removed is known as a lemon shell, and is a notable garnish in drinks as well. Also the basis for juice, extract, syrup, liqueur, and spirit used in drinks.</p>  </div>
