	<h1>Plymouth Gin</h1>
	<p>Also known as Plymouth</p>
	<p>Proprietary dry gin from Plymouth, England. Mild and pleasant, citrus-forward. Available in different proofs. Particularly noted in the Pink Gin.</p>
	<p>Plymouth is treated historically as a distinct style of gin. Some early bar manuals describe it as tasting similar to genever in the 19th Century; most likely the product did evolve with the times but its special treatment may just be an accident of its early prominence and physical separation from London. Contemporary Plymouth Gin actually fits in quite neatly amidst contemporary London dry gins.</p>
	<p>Gin is a generic category for neutral grain spirit infused with juniper berries and other botanical flavorings during or after the distillation process. Principal varieties of gin include genever, Old Tom, and London Dry Gin. Genever is distinguished by its malt wine flavoring, and London Dry gin is distinguished by being resolutely unsweetened—“dry gin”. Generally, when the term “gin” stands alone, London Dry Gin is what is meant. Novel gin styles exist, most of which draw from the same pool of botanical flavorings but emphasize or deemphasize flavors or seek a particularly strong (or particularly mild) overall character.</p>
