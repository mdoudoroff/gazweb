	<h1>Monin Honey</h1>
	<p>Also known as Monin Miel</p>
	<p>Monin Honey is a proprietary example of honey syrup.</p>
	<p>Honey syrup is a home-made or commercial preparation that dissolves honey with some proportion of water in order to make the honey easier to work with as a sweetener and flavoring agent. (Undliuted honey tends to be difficult to dissolve at low temperatures and can be messy.) </p>
	<p>To make: combine equal parts water and honey in a sauce pan on the stove. Heat, stirring, until all the sugar dissolves. (Do not boil.) Cool and bottle. Adding an ounce or so of neutral grain spirits when bottling will help preserve the syrup.</p>
	<p>Honey syrup can also be easily infused with botanicals for creative effects.</p>
