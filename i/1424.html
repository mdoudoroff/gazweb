	<h1>Bacardi 151</h1>
	<p>Also known as Ron Bacardi 151ยบ</p>
	<p>Proprietary 151-proof rum available in White and Dark versions, both aged at least one year. The only difference between the products is that the former is filtered to be colorless and the latter is darkened with caramel coloring for a consistent, darker appearance. The former is dry with little flavor and is mainly useful for its flammability. The latter has a little more flavor because it isn't as filtered, and is popular with some as a punch ingredient.</p>
	<p>151-proof Puerto Rican rum is generic for the light-bodied overproof rums of Puerto Rico, either filtered clear or darkened with caramel color.</p>
