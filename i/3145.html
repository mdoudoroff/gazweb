	<p>Novel semi-dry vermouth with a base of both white and red wines.</p>
	<p>Vermouth is a generic category for several styles of fortified, spiced, aperitif wines, most often distinguished by color: red, white and dry. </p>
	<p>The red (rosso) style is the oldest and apparently first commercialized by the Carpano (CAR-pah-no) distiller in Turin, in the late 18th Century. Red vermouth is usually dark red or brown in color, fairly sweet, and rich. </p>
	<p>The white (blanc/bianco) style is a straw-colored sweet vermouth that is under-appreciated and infrequently specified in cocktails. This style is often the most botanically intense.</p>
	<p>The dry style of vermouth—probably first commercialized by Noilly Prat (NWAH-ee PRAH) in the early 19th Century around Marseille—is also straw-colored, generally slightly sweet, and usually tastes most like a light white wine with herbs.</p>
	<p>Many vermouth producers are in the habit of marketing one or more products in each style, to varying success.</p>
	<p>Regardless of style, all vermouths are built on a white wine base.</p>
	<p>When the term “vermouth” is used alone, the red style is typically what is meant.</p>
