	<h1>activated charcoal powder</h1>
	<p>Activated charcoal powder (be sure it is food grade) is very finely ground carbon that is specially processed to maximize its capacity for absorption. Principle applications are medicinal and cosmetic. Can be safely ingested when wet and has been (uncommonly) used for visual effect in a mixed drink. Flavorless.</p>  </div>
