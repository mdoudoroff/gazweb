	<h1>Combier Liqueur d’Orange</h1>
	<p>Venerable Triple Sec that makes claims to originating the “triple sec” liqueur, a refinement on orange curaçao. Some of these claims may carry weight, although verification remains dicey. Regardless, the Combier product and brand has remained virtually invisible relative to Cointreau, and has only become available in the United States in the last few years. On the positive side, what’s in the bottle is generally well-regarded.</p>
	<p>Triple sec is a branch of curaçao and a generic category for neutral spirit-based refined colorless orange-flavored liqueurs imitative of Cointreau. (Cointreau itself was originally labeled “Triple Sec Curaçao” before trademark concerns led the owners to focus entirely on their brand name.) Some 19th century bar guides appear to use the term “white curacao” to refer to triple sec.</p>
	<p>The principle distinction of triple sec relative to other curaçaos is that the base is a neutral conveyance for a very clean, sophisticated orange flavor, unattainable before the invention of the continuous still. Cheap triple secs usually fall short on sophisticatation.</p>
