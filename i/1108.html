	<h1>cuban rum</h1>
	<p>Cuban rum is rum from Cuba, but it specifically implies the light-bodied style of rum as established and epitomized by the Bacardi rums prior to the Cuban Revolution. The emphasis of this style is distilling to high degree of purity (employing continuous stills). All Cuban rum of this style is aged, although some is stripped of its color (and some of its flavor) through filtering, while others are amber from age and the judicious addition of caramel color for consistency.</p>
