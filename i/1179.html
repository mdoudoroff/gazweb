	<h1>Laphroaig 10 Year Single Malt Scotch</h1>
	<p>One of the most famous single malts and one of the boldest, a heavily peated scotch from Islay (EYE-luh).</p>
	<p>Legally defined scotch producing region limited to the isle of Islay (EYE-luh). Although various other distilleries in Scotland are located next to the sea and derive “terroir” benefit from its proximity, Islay’s distilleries tend to stand out, largely because of  Islay’s distinctive peat that ultimately flavors the whisky produced there. Islay whisky is rightly associated with the “peatiest” and smokiest scotches, although not all of the scotch from Islay is particularly “peaty” or smoky. Ultimately, scotch from Islay is just that, and really connotes no particular style or qualities.</p>
