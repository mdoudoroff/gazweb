	<h1>mate de coca leaves</h1>
	<p>Also known as coca tea leaves</p>
	<p>Coca tea leaves are the commercially dried and processed leaves of the coca plant common in the Andes region of South America. When infused in hot water, the flavor is herbal, with bitter and inherent sweet notes. The brew is mildly stimulative, along the lines of tea. Commercial coca tea in most export markets has been “decocainized” to remove most of the coca alkaloids associated with narcotic extraction.</p>  </div>
