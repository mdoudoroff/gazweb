	<h1>cream</h1>
	<p>Cream is the butterfat-heavy portion of milk, common in dessert cocktails. </p>
	<p>“Whipped cream” has been beaten or otherwise aerated to some extent. “Wet whipped cream,” or “lightly whipped cream” has only been aerated to the extent that it remains more-or-less pourable. As beating continues, the cream becomes more voluminous and structured, passing through a “soft peak” phase, a “hard peak” phase and ultimately collapsing into butter and buttermilk as the final result of “overwhipping”.</p>
	<p>A common contemporary convenience is whipped cream sold in a pressurized spray can and inevitably corrupted with preservatives, stabilizers, flavorings and sugars. The use of these “squirty creams” is highly discouraged for quality cocktails.</p>  </div>
