	<h1>ginger-infused syrup</h1>
	<p>The best ginger syrup is homemade and flavored with fresh ginger root. For short term use, ginger syrup is trivial to make (see below). Commercial versions are generally less impressive but offer long term shelf-stability.</p>
	<p>To make a softer ginger syrup, cut a 2-inch long piece of fresh ginger into thin slices and place in a saucepan with 1 cup sugar and 1 cup water.  Bring to a boil, stir-ring until sugar is dissolved.  Lower heat, cover saucepan, and simmer for 2 minutes.  Remove saucepan from heat and, keeping it covered, let sit for at least 2 hours before straining and bottling.  Store it in the fridge.</p>
	<p>To make a more powerful, “fresh” ginger syrup, combine two parts simple syrup with one part fresh ginger juice (from a juice extractor).</p>
