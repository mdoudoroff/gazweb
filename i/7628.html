	<h1>peach brandy</h1>
	<p>Peach brandy is generic for brandy distilled from fermented peaches and aged in wood. Once popular in America—e.g., Fish House Punch—this spirit was essentially extinct during the 20th Century and is only barely reemerging in the 21st. Not to be confused with peach liqueurs (sometimes misleadingly labeled “peach brandy”), peach brandy is analogous to american apple brandy (and applejack). Note that peach brandy doesn’t “taste like peaches” any more than cognac tastes like grapes—aspects of the fresh fruit’s flavor remain while others are suppressed and esters from distillation and wood aging step forward.</p>
