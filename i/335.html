	<h1>mint</h1>
	<p>Also known as yerba buena</p>
	<p>Mint is generic for the leaf of peppermint or spearmint, used interchangeably in cocktails and related drink forms since the early 19th century or earlier, as a garnish, flavoring, or in preparation form, as a mixer. Often specified as an unquantified “sprig” of mint, a sprig being a stem of mint with 3 or more mint leaves growing out of it. Suffice to say 6 to 8 leaves of mint is appropriate for most drinks calling for mint sprigs or leaves (such as Juleps and Mojitos), but otherwise lacking a listed quantity. Also used as garnish.</p>
	<p>Note: the mint family is quite diverse, both in cultivated and wild, regional forms. The creative application of regionally-available (culinarily suitable) mints is one of the pleasures of mixology.</p>  </div>
