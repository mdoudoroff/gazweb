	<h1>Pierre Ferrand Cognac Ambre</h1>
	<p>Entry level Grande Champagne Cognac from Pierre Ferrand.</p>
	<p>Cognac is generic for a specific regional aged dry grape brandy from the Cognac region of France with mandated grape, distillation, and aging requirements that define it from other brandies. Very popular (and excellent) in cocktails, especially older ones, and in all levels of quality and age.</p>
	<p>Today, most cognac is 40% ABV, but that wasn’t always the case.</p>
