	<h1>rooibus (brewed)</h1>
	<p>Also known as rooibus tea, rooibos tea, redbush tea</p>
	<p>Rooibus is generic for a hot infusion of the dried needles of a medicinal herb plant of the same name, native to South Africa. Infusions of rooibus inherit its reddish brown hue and rich, nutty, almost malty flavor. A “green” rooibus (unoxidized) is also produced, but this style is relatively rare and expensive.</p>
	<p>Note: rooibus is sometimes sold as "red tea". This nomenclature is problematic, because rooibus is not tea, and the fully-oxidized tea that Westerners commonly call “black tea” is actually called “red tea” in China.</p>
