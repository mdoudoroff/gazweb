	<h1>habanero</h1>
	<p>Habanero is generic for a defunct bottled spirit containing either aged fermented sugarcane juice or aged rum and sweetened either with Muscat wine or sweet brandy—most often of Mexican manufacture. The name, unlike that of the accented pepper, means “citizen of Havana”. Produced by several companies, and popular with the North-of-the-Border Hollywood-elite crowd of the 1940s in their South-of-the-Border forays.</p>
