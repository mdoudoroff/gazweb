	<h1>sherry</h1>
	<p>Also known as vino de Jerez, sack</p>
	<p>Sherry is a generic category for specific fortified wines of Spain. “Sherry” is an anglicization of “Jerez,” which is the Spanish town that produced the fortified wine known first as sack and now as sherry. Sherry begins as a dry white wine from regional grapes that is fortified with brandy, sweetened, and aged in casks according to the solera method. Sherry is sold in several styles, including fino, oloroso, manzanilla, amontillado, and cream (a blend of sweet sherries; no dairy products are involved).</p>
