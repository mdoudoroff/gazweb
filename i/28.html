	<h1>Campari</h1>
	<p>Also known as bitter Campari, Campari bitters</p>
	<p>Proprietary celebrated bittersweet Italian beverage/aperitif bitters produced since 1860, by the company bearing its name, of herbs and fruit in a neutral spirit base. Noted for its use in the NEGRONI Cocktail among others.</p>
	<p>Amaro is a generic term for intensely-flavored aperitif/digestif bitters of Italian origin. Similar to the French “amer”. Italian amari are generally higher proof than their French counterparts (with notable exceptions) and most focus on the digestif role, rather the aperitif role (again, with notable exceptions).</p>
