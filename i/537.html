	<h1>Noilly Prat Original Dry</h1>
	<p>Also known as Noilly Prat</p>
	<p>Pronounced NWAH-ee PRAH (don’t pronounce the els or tee). Proprietary brand of dry vermouth. Note that Noilly Prat also produces a red vermouth, but it is their dry vermouth they are known for and any cocktail recipe specifying "Noilly Prat" is specifying their dry vermouth.</p>
	<p>Dry vermouth is generic for the “dry” style of vermouth, which emerged in France fairly early on during the commercialization of vermouth in the late 18th Century. Dry vermouth was probably first commercialized by Noilly Prat (NWAH-ee PRAH) in the early 19th Century around Marseille, although the dry styles of Marseilles and Savoy (Chambery) are considered distinct. Dry vermouth is a fortified wine and herb aperitif, straw-colored-transparent. The use of dry vermouth (principally from France) in cocktails in America exploded in the 1880s on the heels of the popularization of red vermouth (from Italy).</p>
