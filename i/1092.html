	<h1>crushed ice</h1>
	<p>Also known as bits of ice, fine ice, finely cracked ice</p>
	<p>Crushed ice is ice that has been literally crushed into small, randomly-sized bits through mechanical means. Crushed ice is achieved either by feeding ice cubes through an electric or manual ice crusher, or by placing the cubes in a sack and pounding the sack with a mallet. In terms of relative granularity, crushed ice is finer than cracked ice but courser than shaved ice.</p>
	<p>An alternative to crushed ice is high quality pellet ice.</p>  </div>
