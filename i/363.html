	<h1>simple syrup</h1>
	<p>Simple syrup is a high-concentration water and sugar solution, either prepared at home or available commercially. See also cane syrup, rock candy syrup, gomme syrup, capillaire syrup and syrup.</p>
	<p>Home made simple syrup can be produced with varying sweetness levels based on proportions from the very sweet 3 parts sugar to 1 part water to the very simple formula of equal parts of each. Drink recipes may require adjustment based on the proportions chosen.</p>
	<p>Basic process: fill a bottle halfway with granulated sugar and halfway with filtered water. Cap the bottle and shake it vigorously for several seconds. Set it down for several minutes to allow it to settle, then shake it some more. In time, all of the sugar will have dissolved in the water creating a 1:1 simple syrup. As indicated above, proportions may be adjusted to make stronger, thicker syrup, though the more sugar used, the longer dissolution will take. Using "superfine" granulated sugar (*not confectioners or powdered sugar*) speeds dilution.</p>
	<p>The entire process may be accelerated by stirring the sugar and water (at whatever proportional balance is chosen) at a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat. Care should be taken to regulate the heat as anything over a simmer may create a frothy scum that requires removal.</p>
	<p>Finally, it can be useful to stir in a small quantity of neutral grain spirits (or vodka) as a preservative if long storage is planned.</p>
	<p>Note about volume: most simple syrup proportions assume the casual measurement of sugar by dry volume, rather than weight. There is a significant difference, as 1 cup of dry crystalline sugar will add considerably less than 1 cup of volume to 1 cup of water, once the two are combined. If you follow the same given proportions but weigh the sugar as a baker would, the resulting syrup will be significantly sweeter.</p>
	<p>Simple syrup can be produced for a single drink simply by adding castor sugar (preferably “superfine”) to an empty mixing glass, adding a splash of water, and stirring until dissolved. Many drink recipes specify as much (“sugar dissolved in splash of water”). Sugar is reluctant to dissolve in alcohol, so be sure to dissolve the sugar before adding any.</p>
