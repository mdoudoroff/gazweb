	<h1>citrus juice</h1>
	<p>Citrus juices is a generic category for the astringent pressed juice of the fresh fruit from a range of tropical and sub-tropical trees, most prominently, the cultivated hybrids lemon, lime, orange and grapefruit.</p>
	<p>In cocktails, the pressed juices of citrus fruit are amongst the most common ingredients. The essential oil-rich outermost layer of the leathery rind of citrus fruit is also used for garnishing drinks and creating infusions. Moreover, during pressing, some of these essential oils are inevitably contributed—and welcomed—into the juice.</p>
	<p>Once pressed, citrus juice must be used fairly promptly, because it oxidizes and loses its fresh character. In mixed drinks, it is preferable to squeeze citrus juices at the time of assembling the drink, although citrus juices will keep for a couple hours in a sealed, chilled container. Note that citrus juices that are left to stand will separate, and require shaking or stirring to re-integrate.</p>  </div>
