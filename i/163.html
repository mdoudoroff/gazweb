	<h1>Grand Marnier</h1>
	<p>Proprietary French aged orange liqueur in brandy base of great acclaim; available bottled in various agings. Invented by Louis Alexandre Marnier-Lapostolle in 1880, its name was an ironic thumbing of the nose at other French liqueurs of the era - which often began with the word "Petit". Notable in the Satan’s Whiskers (Straight) Cocktail.</p>
	<p>Note: Grand Marnier is essentially a super-deluxe curaçao.</p>
	<p>Orange-flavored liqueur with an aged brandy base is a generic category for orange liqueurs that prominently feature flavorful aged grape brandy as a base, as exemplified by Grand Marnier. This category emerged in the late 19th Century as a natural product extension for grape brandy producers, and good examples are produced with great care in alembic stills alongside their brandy components.</p>
	<p>These products are an up-market evolution of curaçao wherein the flavor from refined aged brandy plays an equal role with orange in the liqueur. As such, these products may be divergent enough from simpler curaçao liqueurs to be a poor substitute in some situations; the essential distinction is how the brandy flavor will play.</p>
	<p>By contrast, these ingredients generally stand well on their own as a cordial.</p>
