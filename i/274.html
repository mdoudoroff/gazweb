	<h1>apple juice</h1>
	<p>Apple juice is generic for the pressed juice of apples, generally with a higher sugar content and a lower acid content than “apple cider”, generally (but not always) filtered to remove any cloudiness, and usually pasteurized. Note that differences between what is “apple juice” and what is “apple cider” varies widely by brand, and sometimes there is NO difference.</p>
