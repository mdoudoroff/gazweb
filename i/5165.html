	<h1>Capel Pisco</h1>
	<p>This entry refers to an export market (to the USA) proprietary pisco simply labeled “Pisco Capel” and probably corresponding to the “Pisco Capel Reservado” product in Chile.</p>
	<p>Pisco is a generic category for traditional Peruvian or Chilean grape eau de vie, not typically wood-aged, or only subtly wood-aged. With Peruvian pisco, products are typically distinguished by the grape(s) employed, and the product name often reflects that. For example “Quebranta” indicates the Quebranta grape. “Pure” (“puro”) implies that only a single grape varietal is employed in that particular randy, whereas “Acholado” indicates a blend of grapes. Chilean pisco is usually a blend of different grapes, but employs additional labeling terminology related to proof (Regular, Special, Control, Reserve and Great, in ascending order of ABV).</p>
