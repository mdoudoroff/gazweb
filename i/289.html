	<h1>hard cider</h1>
	<p>Also known as cider</p>
	<p>Cider is the bottled fermented juice of apples. Cider varies considerably in sweetness and character depending on the varietals employed and how it is crafted.</p>
	<p>Cider is typically consumed like beer or wine, but can also serve as a “mixer”. In the U.K., hard cider is sometimes mixed, about 50/50, with amber ale to make a drink known as The Snake Bite, and the British are also known to add Pernod to their hard cider, ordered as Pernod and cider.</p>
	<p>The United States is the only country to also refer to unfermented apple juice as “cider”, fallout from Prohibition.</p>
