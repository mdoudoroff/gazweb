	<h1>Absolut Vodka</h1>
	<p>Also known as Absolut Blank, Absolut Masquerade</p>
	<p>Proprietary vodka; the baseline Absolut product. Note that “Absolut Masquerade” and “Absolut Blank Edition” are merely novelty packagings.</p>
	<p>Vodka is a generic category for neutral spirit, diluted and filtered through charcoal. Dependent on the nature of the distillate, the temperature and number of distillations, the nature of the diluting water, additives (such as glycerin) and the number of filtrations for any particular brand’s given character. Vodka can be made from many bases: grain, potato, beet, cane, or rice. “Vodka” is diminutive for “voda”, the word for water in Russian. Vodka was traditionally unflavored (other than the flavor of the alcohol itself) and infusions of flavoring ingredients garnered the spirit a different name, depending upon the ingredient(s) added. In current-day parlance, flavored renditions are all considered subsets of vodka, so-named. Vodka was historically traditional mainly to Russia, Poland, and Latvia.</p>
