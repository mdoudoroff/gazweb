	<h1>Tanqueray No. 10</h1>
	<p>Also known as Tanqueray 10</p>
	<p>Proprietary London Dry Gin introduced in 2000 to serve as an alternative gin for Martinis.</p>
	<p>London dry gin is generic for the de facto sharp, bone-dry style of gin that has dominated the market since the late 19th Century: a column-still distillate of grain with juniper and other botanicals. The vast bulk of all gins employed in cocktails are London dry gin. Gins identifying themselves as “dry gin” are imitative or sympathetic to the London Dry style. Beefeater London Dry Gin and Tanqueray London Dry Gin would be prominent definitive examples of the style, which encompasses legions of brands.</p>
	<p>Historical note: dry gin was not really part of the American bar until the 1890s. All references to “gin” before this period are to genever. The other gin of that era was “old tom gin”, which was nearly always refered to as such or as “tom gin”.</p>
