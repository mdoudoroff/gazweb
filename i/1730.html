	<h1>orange-flavored liqueur with an aged brandy base</h1>
	<p>Orange-flavored liqueur with an aged brandy base is a generic category for orange liqueurs that prominently feature flavorful aged grape brandy as a base, as exemplified by Grand Marnier. This category emerged in the late 19th Century as a natural product extension for grape brandy producers, and good examples are produced with great care in alembic stills alongside their brandy components.</p>
	<p>These products are an up-market evolution of curaçao wherein the flavor from refined aged brandy plays an equal role with orange in the liqueur. As such, these products may be divergent enough from simpler curaçao liqueurs to be a poor substitute in some situations; the essential distinction is how the brandy flavor will play.</p>
	<p>By contrast, these ingredients generally stand well on their own as a cordial.</p>
