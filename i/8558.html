	<h1>Bols Corenwyn 6 Year</h1>
	<p>Bols Corenwyn 6 Year is a proprietary example of korenwijn.</p>
	<p>Korenwijn is a relatively recently-introduced Dutch style of genever including at least 51% malt wine in the blend, containing no more than 20 grams sugar/liter and bottled at  35% ABV or more. The result is a comparatively malt-forward, “sweet tasting” smooth liquor as one might sip neat or on the rocks. Korenwijn may be bottled unaged or aged at least one year in barrels of less than 700 liters.</p>
