	<h1>sweet cider</h1>
	<p>Also known as apple cider</p>
	<p>Apple cider is, in the United States (fallout from Prohibition), generic for the non-alcoholic juice of pressed apples. Prior to prohibition, the term used would be “sweet cider”. Often, “apple cider” indicates less filtration (cloudier appearance and texture) and non-pasteurization than “apple juice”. Note that differences between what is “apple juice” and what is “apple cider” varies by brand, and sometimes there is no difference.</p>
