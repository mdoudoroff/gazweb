	<h1>Martini & Rossi Dry Vermouth</h1>
	<p>Also known as Martini Extra Dry</p>
	<p>Proprietary dry vermouth from Italy.</p>
	<p>Dry vermouth is generic for the “dry” style of vermouth, which emerged in France fairly early on during the commercialization of vermouth in the late 18th Century. Dry vermouth was probably first commercialized by Noilly Prat (NWAH-ee PRAH) in the early 19th Century around Marseille, although the dry styles of Marseilles and Savoy (Chambery) are considered distinct. Dry vermouth is a fortified wine and herb aperitif, straw-colored-transparent. The use of dry vermouth (principally from France) in cocktails in America exploded in the 1880s on the heels of the popularization of red vermouth (from Italy).</p>
