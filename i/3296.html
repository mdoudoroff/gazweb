	<h1>Bittermens Burlesque Bitters</h1>
	<p>Bittermens Burlesque Bitters is a proprietary example of novel bitters.</p>
	<p>“Novel bitters” is an ad hoc assortment of proprietary cocktail bitters that were invariably introduced beginning in the 2010s and are unprecedented in style. Most could also be described as “culinarily-inspired”, attempting to to deliver a concentrated essence of a cuisine, cooking flavor, or other spirit. </p>
	<p>Generally, the specificity of these products is absolute, but they are all designed for use in cocktails. With careful discretion, it may be possible to substitute many of these bitters for a prototypical aromatic bitters (i.e., Angostura Bitters) in a mixed drink, although these products will all add a new, unsubtle flavor to the resulting drink.</p>
