	<h1>Dubonnet</h1>
	<p>Also known as red Dubonnet</p>
	<p>Proprietary French quinquina in sweet (red) and less-sweet (blonde) varieties. Unquestionably, the most famous quinquina made. Called for in a variety of cocktails, one of them named for it: the Dubonnet Cocktail (which, for a time, Dubonnet also produced in a bottled form. Notable in the Blackthorn Cocktail.</p>
	<p>Caveat emptor: Dubonnet has long been produced independently in France and Kentucky. The respective products are not entirely equivalent. Moreover, the latter is also sold in the USA in a green-labeled “white” variation that is completely different while being confusingly labeled.</p>
	<p>Quinquina is generic for sweetened fortified aperitif wines containing quinine (thus “quinquina”) and spices. The major brands are: Bonal, Byrrh, Dubonnet, Lillet, and St. Raphael. The quinine is the bitter constituent which promotes production of digestive enzymes and, therefore, appetite. Most quinquinas are produced from mistelle (fortified grape juice) rather than actual fermented wine.</p>
