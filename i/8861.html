	<h1>earl grey-infused honey syrup</h1>
	<p>Earl grey honey syrup is generic for (typically) homemade honey syrup infused with earl grey tea (black tea flavored with bergamot). To produce, boil 8 oz water in a sauce pan, turn off the heat and add a few earl grey tea bags. Infuse for about three minutes. Remove the tea bags, and stir in 16 oz honey. (You may need to apply additional heat in order to fully dissolve the honey.) Cool, bottle and keep refrigerated. The same process can be employed with other teas and tisanes.</p>  </div>
