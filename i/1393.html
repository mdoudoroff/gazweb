	<h1>masala chai</h1>
	<p>Also known as chai, chai tea</p>
	<p>Masala chai is a spiced tea beverage preparation in a style from the Indian subcontinent. In the West, there is considerable confusion about the terminology: “chai” simply means “tea”. “Masala chai” is the spiced style, which can be made with hot water or steamed milk (or even soy milk). The latter is sometimes referred to as “chai latte” in Western coffeehouses, but this is two etymologies commingling in a third.</p>
	<p>There is no standard for the spices employed in masala chai, although cardamom and anise are popular. Note that masala chai blends can be built with different tea styles, or even without actual tea leaves at all.</p>  </div>
