	<h1>maraschino cherries</h1>
	<p>Maraschino cherry, contemporarily, is a commercially produced, bleached, brightly-dyed (red or green) and artificially-flavored pitted cherries preserved in sugar syrup, often with almond extract. No relation to Maraschino liqueur.</p>
	<p>Historically (late 19th Century), Maraschino cherries were actual marasca cherries macerated in maraschino liqueur and bottled for export from Croatia. These very dark, rich cherries were gradually supplanted in the American market by the mass-produced, brightly colored, unnatural cherries many are now accustomed to.</p>
