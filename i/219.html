	<h1>Pernod</h1>
	<p>Also known as Pernod Veritas</p>
	<p>Proprietary French sweetened anis-flavored absinthe substitute named for the company that once produced the most popular absinthe before the French banned it in 1915. Current-day pernod lacks the wormwood (and potent alcohol strength) that gave absinthe its singular "kick."</p>
	<p>Note that Pernod is once again producing absinthe alongside its pastis. The labeling is similar, but not identical.</p>
	<p>Pastis is generic for lightly-sweetened anis-flavored absinthe substitutes, traditionally French and with a method of production like that of Ricard, the brand that coined the term. Currently a general term for sweet/bitter spirits envisioned as substitutes for absinthe, (minus the wormwood) but with similar character. Prominent brand examples include Absente, Herbsaint, Pastis 51, Pernod, and Ricard. Not to be confused with other, sweeter anis-flavored liqueurs like anisette.</p>
	<p>Note that, with careful discretion, it can be possible to substitute a true absinthe for pastis in some mixed drinks, particularly when only a small quantity is employed as an accent. In larger doses, the significantly higher proof of absinthe can be problematic.</p>
