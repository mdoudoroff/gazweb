	<h1>Lillet Blanc</h1>
	<p>Also known as white Lillet</p>
	<p>Proprietary French quinquina and 1980s reformulation of now-defunct Kina Lillet.</p>
	<p>Caveat emptor: both a straw-colored and deep red-colored product are marketed under identical “Lillet” labeling. A recipe that specifies "Lillet" without also specifying “rouge”, “red” or “sweet” most likely implies Kina Lillet (the defunct product). Lillet Blanc would be the natural substitute, although Cocchi Americano may actually be closer.</p>
	<p>Quinquina is generic for sweetened fortified aperitif wines containing quinine (thus “quinquina”) and spices. The major brands are: Bonal, Byrrh, Dubonnet, Lillet, and St. Raphael. The quinine is the bitter constituent which promotes production of digestive enzymes and, therefore, appetite. Most quinquinas are produced from mistelle (fortified grape juice) rather than actual fermented wine.</p>
