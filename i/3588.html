	<h1>Tabu Absinth Classic Strong</h1>
	<p>Also known as Tabu Absinth 73º</p>
	<p>Tabu Absinth Classic Strong is a proprietary example of faux absinthe.</p>
	<p>Faux absinthe are products labeled absinthe (or absinth) that are not, in fact, true absinthe. Although adulterated and fake absinthes are not new, this category applies to a swath of products that have existed only since the 1990s, most of which are produced in the Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, and Spain. Faux absinthes are, essentially, compounded flavored vodkas with strange, generally disagreeable flavors far removed from those of real absinthe. Faux absinthe is sometimes referred to as “Bohemian” or “Czech-style”, and often is dyed a lurid hue of blue, bright green, or red. Products in this category that claim historical or traditional authenticity would probably have difficulty providing substantiation.</p>
	<p>[We endeavor to keep the products labeled “absinthe” sorted correctly and appreciate any assistance.-ed.]</p>
