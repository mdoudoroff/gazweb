	<h1>block of ice</h1>
	<p>Block ice is a single large piece of ice. Size is relative, with no upper bound and punch-bowl sized at the small end. In any case, far too large to fit in a glass. Block ice is typically the raw product from which other kinds of ice are formed or created for serving purposes. The primary tools for working with block ice are a saw, a chisel and a mallet.</p>  </div>
