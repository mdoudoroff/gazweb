	<h1>Aperol</h1>
	<p>Also known as Aperitivo Aperol</p>
	<p>Proprietary low-poof orange-flavored and orange-colored aperitif bitters. The labels explicitly credit the product to Barbieri Brothers in 1919, and admit to “an infusion of orange, rhubarb, china and gentian”. ("China" in this case means cinchona.) Today, Aperol is “produced from the original recipe of Barbieri” by Campari, and could be described as “like Campari” but milder, with the orange flavor dominant, and a yellower (orange) color.</p>
	<p>Amaro is a generic term for intensely-flavored aperitif/digestif bitters of Italian origin. Similar to the French “amer”. Italian amari are generally higher proof than their French counterparts (with notable exceptions) and most focus on the digestif role, rather the aperitif role (again, with notable exceptions).</p>
