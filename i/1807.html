	<h1>Petite Canne Sugar Cane Syrup</h1>
	<p>Petite Canne Sugar Cane Syrup is a proprietary example of cane syrup (filtered).</p>
	<p>Filtered cane syrup refers to the syrup produced by boiling down fresh sugar cane juice and carefully filtering out the molasses solids. This golden syrup is sweet, thick, relatively stable, and preserves the delicate vegetal essence of the sugar cane juice. True sugar cane syrup is versatile and as sublime a sweetener as quality honey and is highly recommended if you can get it. Petit Canne is a notable producer.</p>
	<p>Caveat emptor: many products are commonly found on the market labeled “cane syrup”, but are actually of the unfiltered variety. Almost all filtered cane syrup comes from Martinique and doesn't taste or smell of molasses. Almost all other cane syrup tastes and smells of molasses.</p>
