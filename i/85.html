	<h1>acid phosphate</h1>
	<p>Also known as Horsford's Acid Phosphate, lemon phosphate</p>
	<p>Acid phosphate is the liquid suspension of calcium phosphate and other chemicals. Highly regarded in its day for its healthful attributes and more closely associated with the pharmacy soda fountain than the bar. Employed to impart dryness (as in a dry wine) to cocktails. Also used as an occasional substitute for lemon or lime juice when fresh fruit was not available. Cocktail example: the Montauk Riding Club Cocktail.</p>
