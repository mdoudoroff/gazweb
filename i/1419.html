	<h1>Bärenjäger Honey Liqueur</h1>
	<p>Proprietary for the most popular of German (Prussian) neutral spirit-based liqueurs, sweetened and potently flavored with honey. Compounded, it is said, since the late 15th century. The word translates as "bear hunter" and "baren" (bear) is always used as a prefix for German honey-flavored liqueurs. "Jager" says something of the age and folk origins of this spirit. Produced by Teucke & König, a company that once manufactured bear traps.</p>
	<p>Honey-flavored liqueur is a generic category for liqueurs incorporating honey—generally as the sweetening agent and primary flavoring—with neutral spirits and herbs and spices. This category has enormous latitude for diversity, so discretion is required.</p>
