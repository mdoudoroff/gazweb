	<h1>raw sugar syrup</h1>
	<p>Also known as muscovado sugar syrup, demerara sugar syrup, turbinado sugar syrup, demerara simple syrup</p>
	<p>Raw sugar syrup is generic for a simple syrup made with so-called raw sugar, which is not raw, but is less processed than refined sugar. Raw sugar—also known as Demerara sugar or muscovado sugar—retains a little more molasses flavor than refined sugar, and tends to have a larger grain. Consequently, simple syrups made with raw sugar can turn out slightly weaker than simple syrups made with refined sugar, at least when measuring the sugar by volume.</p>
	<p>To make, simply combine one part raw sugar and one part water (by weight) in a sauce pan, heat and stir until dissolved. Cool and bottle.</p>  </div>
