	<h1>Linie Aquavit</h1>
	<p>Also known as Lysholm Linie Aquavit</p>
	<p>Proprietary Norwegian aquavit with a potato distillate base that allegedly enjoys considerable shipboard aging in used sherry casks (see reverse of label for a “travel log”).</p>
	<p>Aquavit is generic for traditional Scandinavian caraway-infused neutral spirit. Most brands are not aged. Notably, however, Linie Aquavit is aged in cask shipboard traveling from Oslo, Norway down under the equator, and back again - giving it a softer mouthfeel and light amber color uncharacteristic for aquavits. The ship and date a particular bottle of Linie aquavit made this journey may be viewed on the reverse of the front label, looking through the bottle to see this information. Both versions of aquavit are excellent.</p>
