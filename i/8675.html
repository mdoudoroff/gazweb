	<h1>oolong tea leaves</h1>
	<p>Also known as oolong tea bag</p>
	<p>Oolong tea is semi-oxidized tea processed into a wide variety of forms. Some oolong is less-oxidized and “greener”; other oolong is more oxidied “blacker”. The former tends to produce more delicate, yellowgreen, floral infusions; the latter tends to produce earthier, richer, browner infusions. Oolong, as a category, is probably the most complex and varied category of teas.</p>
	<p>Oolong tea is produced in China and Taiwan.</p>
