	<h1>El Dorado 5 Year</h1>
	<p>El Dorado 5 Year is a proprietary example of demerara rum.</p>
	<p>Demerara rum is generic for the distinctive heavy-bodied dark rums in various proofs from the country of Guyana. The name Demerara is inherited from the British colony of Demerara, now a region of Guyana.</p>
	<p>As of this writing, all distilling in Guayana is centralized under Demerara Distillers Ltd., so all Demerara rum today is produced at this distillery, regardless of brand.</p>
	<p>Guyana is particularly known for its aged, rich, heavy-bodied dark brown rums, suitable for sipping or mixing, and it is these that are implied by “Demerara rum” unless otherwise qualified. Guyana also produces a few filtered (“white”) rums and some overproof products.</p>
