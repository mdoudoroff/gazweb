	<h1>aged rum</h1>
	<p>“Aged rum” is technically generic for any style of rum other than unaged or “white rum”, and is therefore ambiguous because rums of vastly different style are available in aged form. Note that the color of rum is not necessarily indicative of aging insofar as much colorless rum is actually aged and then stripped of its color through filtering. Moreover, caramel color is often introduced to rums to darken their coloration. Generally, if a recipe simply specifies aged rum, an appealing brown molasses-based rum is implied.</p>  </div>
