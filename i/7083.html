	<p>Cucumber is a cultivated fresh gourd with a green skin and pale whitish flesh and seeds. Commonly available in various sizes and characteristics. Some have thicker waxier skins. Some are essentially seedless. Cucumbers are used as drink garnishes, mashed up to infuse drinks, and even hollowed out into drinking vessels.</p>  </div>
