	<h1>VS cognac</h1>
	<p>Also known as three stars cognac</p>
	<p>V.S. cognac is an official, legally enforced grade of cognac, and the contemporary, approximate replacement for the defunct term “three star cognac”. VS stands for “Very Special” and indicates that the brandies in the product are at least two years old (although the average may be much older than that). Unfortunately, while the VS designation does presumably guarantee a fact about the particular brandy, it should not be presumed to impart other objective or subjective qualities to a product. This distinction is of primary interest for degustation. For mixed drinks purposes, any cognac will usually do.</p>
