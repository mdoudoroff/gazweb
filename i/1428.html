	<h1>Lemon Hart 151-proof Demerara Rum</h1>
	<p>Proprietary, flavorful, high-proof dark Demerara rum produced under longstanding contract by Demerara Distillers for a bottler (Canadian as of this writing in 2013). This particular product has proven uniquely indispensable as an ingredient in many “exotic” tropical drinks to the extent that it is its own category. As of this writing, this rum has no meaningful competition in its de facto category, although competition would be welcomed. While not a distinguished rum on its own from a connoisseur’s perspective, the combination of flavor and proof offer something essential that cannot be otherwise reproduced.</p>
	<p>151-proof Demerara rum is generic for overproof brown rum produced in Guyana. As of 2013, there is only one product in this category: Lemon Hart 151º. There is no substitute.</p>
