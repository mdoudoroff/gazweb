	<h1>ginger powder</h1>
	<p>Ginger powder is a pungent, peppery, slightly sweet & spicy root from which is derived dried ground ginger powder. Ginger has long been a common cocktail constituent as a flavoring extract, liqueur, spirit & wine constituent, and in preparation form, as a mixer. Long respected for its medicinal qualitiesâ€”even in cocktails. Also used as garnish, either powdered or in thinly shaved slices.</p>  </div>
