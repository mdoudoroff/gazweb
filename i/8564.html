	<h1>Monin Gomme Syrup</h1>
	<p>Monin Gomme Syrup is a proprietary example of gomme syrup.</p>
	<p>Gomme syrup is a high-concentration water and sugar solution, with the addition of gum arabic as an emulsifier. Used as a primary sweetening agent in drinks; and, in combination with fresh lemon and/or lime juice, precludes the need for sweet and sour mix. The term “gum” or “gomme” has come to mean simple sugar syrup in latter-day common parlance.</p>
	<p>It is possible to acquire gum arabic through mail order services and produce your own gomme syrup. The gum arabic contributes a silkier, thicker mouthfeel in simple, old-fashioned liquor-heavy cocktails such as the Whiskey Cocktail, but the difference won’t be appreciable in most other drinks. For instructions, please see “Imbibe!” by David Wondrich (Penguin Books, 2007).</p>
