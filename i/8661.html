	<h1>shrub</h1>
	<p>Also known as drinking vinegar</p>
	<p>Shrub is a concentrate of acid, sugar and fruit. In practical terms, shrubs break down into two principle groups: citrus shrubs and vinegar shrubs (a.k.a. “drinking vinegar”). The former are usually oleo-saccharums dissolved in the pressed juice of the same fruit, such as a lemon oleo-saccharum dissolved in lemon juice. The result is sweet, sour and highly aromatic. </p>
	<p>The latter are stone fruit and/or other suitable ingredients (e.g., rhubarb) that are either cooked down in sugar syrup (hot method) or macerated in granulated sugar (cold method) and then dissolved in vinegar. Again, the result is sweet, sour and highly aromatic.</p>
	<p>Shrub is then employed as a punch or mixed drink ingredient, or simply diluted to taste in water or seltzer for drinking.</p>  </div>
