	<h1>yellow Chartreuse</h1>
	<p>Also known as Yellow Chartreuse, Liqueur Jaune</p>
	<p>Proprietary classic French high proof multi-herbal monastic liqueur of the lighter, sweeter yellow variety (the stronger green being the earlier type) and a brandy base. Only three Carthusian monks know the formula of herbs and flowers used in  the 80 proof yellow Chartreuse at any given time. </p>
	<p>It is still produced today (now in Voiron) on monastery property as it has been since 1838. It is called for in many cocktails.</p>
	<p>Monastic liqueur is a generic category for domestic or imported herb and spice liqueurs produced in the style of Benedictine, Chartreuse, Claristine, Izarra, Vieille Cure, Aiguebelle and other liqueurs produced currently, or at one time, by religious orders.</p>
