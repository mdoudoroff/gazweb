	<h1>green Chartreuse</h1>
	<p>Also known as Chartreuse, Liqueur Verde, Chartreuse Verte</p>
	<p>Proprietary potent classic French high proof multi-herbal monastic liqueur of the green variety. Only three Carthusian monks know the formula of 130 herbs and flowers for the 110 proof Chartreuse at any given time. </p>
	<p>It is still produced today (now in Voiron) on monastery property as it has been since 1764. It was spawned by the more concentrated and intense Elixir Vegetal, and has itself since spawned a yellow variety (in 1838). Called for in many cocktails, notably the Widow's Kiss.</p>
	<p>Any recipe referencing “Chartreuse” without further qualification implies this basic green expression.</p>
	<p>Monastic liqueur is a generic category for domestic or imported herb and spice liqueurs produced in the style of Benedictine, Chartreuse, Claristine, Izarra, Vieille Cure, Aiguebelle and other liqueurs produced currently, or at one time, by religious orders.</p>
