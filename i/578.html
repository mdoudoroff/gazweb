	<h1>Hendrick’s gin</h1>
	<p>Proprietary for premium dry gin noted for its place of manufacture: Scotland, its old fashioned cylindrical bottle, and its use of cucumber as an additional flavoring constituent.</p>
	<p>Gin is a generic category for neutral grain spirit infused with juniper berries and other botanical flavorings during or after the distillation process. Principal varieties of gin include genever, Old Tom, and London Dry Gin. Genever is distinguished by its malt wine flavoring, and London Dry gin is distinguished by being resolutely unsweetened—“dry gin”. Generally, when the term “gin” stands alone, London Dry Gin is what is meant. Novel gin styles exist, most of which draw from the same pool of botanical flavorings but emphasize or deemphasize flavors or seek a particularly strong (or particularly mild) overall character.</p>
