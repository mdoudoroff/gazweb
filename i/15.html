	<h1>absinthe</h1>
	<p>Also known as absynth, absinth</p>
	<p>Absinthe is the generic category for distilled high proof spirit-based aperitif flavored with anise and wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) and often infused with petite wormwood (Artemisia pontica), melissa and hyssop. Principally drunk diluted with chilled water. Also employed in simple cocktails either showcasing it or as an accent; many more cocktails citing it were actually formulated for the use of absinthe substitutes like Herbsaint or Pernod (post-1913). </p>
	<p>Absinthe bans were enacted in many countries in the 1912-1915 period due, in part, to the allegedly deleterious effects of the thujone-laden wormword, and in part to the indigence, and crime associated with the burgeoning consumption of alcohol as a result of the move from agrarian to industrial society and the urban blight associated therewith. </p>
	<p>Absinthe enjoyed a (continuing) rebirth of popularity in the late 1990s largely founded upon its mythical taboo status. Many new brands of widely varying qualities and quality have appeared based on tenuous historical pretexts. Recent research into the chemistry of absinthe has been upending longstanding regulatory restrictions on absinthe distribution, and genuine absinthes are beginning to reenter formerly-closed markets such as the United States.</p>
	<p>The current (c. 2013) marketplace is divided amongst true absinthes and a surprisingly large and tenacious number of faux-absinthes that are, essentially, compounded flavored vodkas with strange, generally disagreeable flavors far removed from those of real absinthe. Caveat emptor. Faux absinthe is sometimes referred to as “Bohemian” or “Czech-style”, and often is dyed a lurid hue of blue, bright green, or red. Faux absinthe is principally produced in the Czech Republic, Spain, Germany, Bulgaria and Austria, but some true absinthes are also produced in some of those countries.</p>
