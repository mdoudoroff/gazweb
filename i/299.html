	<h1>coffee</h1>
	<p>Coffee is the beverage derived from seeds (beans), of the plant of the same name, roasted and ground for beverage use and used as a popular mixer in hot and cold mixed drinks. It is rarely used in cocktails per s√©, though, in small quantities, it is an excellent mixer in that regard. The beans and grinds themselves are occasionally used as garnish or flavoring and as the basis for liqueurs and syrups.</p>  </div>
