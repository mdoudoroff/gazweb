	<h1>yerba mate leaves</h1>
	<p>Also known as mate blend, yerba mate tea bag, mate leaves, yerba mate blend</p>
	<p>Yerba mate leaves are the dried and processed leaves of a South American shrub. When brewed in hot water, a popular Latin American beverage—mate—is produced. Mate contains a few stimulant compounds (xanthines), including caffeine, and is considered to have medicinal qualities. Drinking mate is ubiquitous in various South American cultures, similar to drinking tea, but with its own traditions.</p>  </div>
