	<h1>hibiscus syrup</h1>
	<p>Hibiscus syrup is a commercial or home-made sugar syrup infused with hibiscus petals. Sometimes entire flowers are left in the syrup which can be lifted out with a spoon and deployed as an arresting, edible garnish.</p>
	<p>To produce hibiscus syrup, combine a quantity of simple syrup (e.g., 2 cups) with a significant quantity (e.g., 1 cup) of dried hibiscus blossoms, which can be readily acquired at latin american markets, often labaled “jamaica”. Infuse to taste for as long as a week, then strain and filter through cheesecloth (or don't, depending on your application). The resulting syrup will be dark maroon.</p>  </div>
