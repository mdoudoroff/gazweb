	<h1>applejack</h1>
	<p>Also known as apple jack, apple whiskey</p>
	<p>Applejack is generic for the first New World-native distilled spirit (at least in the colonies that became the United States), first produced in the 17th century by English or European settlers in America. Currently it is often (but not always) blended with neutral spirits. Sometimes a bit of sweet apple wine is added to increase the depth and apple flavor of the bottled product. Excellent in cocktails.</p>
	<p>Applejack is distinct from European apple brandy in character, as the former is aged like whiskey and therefore more resembles and behaves like whiskey, whereas European apple brandy (chiefly Calvados) is aged like grape brandy. Note that not all American apple brandy is apple jack: especially today, American distillers are experimenting with different profiles and aging techniques.</p>
